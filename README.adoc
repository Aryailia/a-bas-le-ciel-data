This compiles all the metadata for the YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/HeiJinZhengZhi/videos[Ã -bas-le-ciel] to produce the https://aryailia.github.io/a-bas-le-ciel[a convenient index] with permission of the creator, Eisel Mazard.

The big-picture setup of these two projects is to make use of GitHub actions to automatically poll YouTube and build the website video index.
This projects handles the former.

== Git Branch and Project Directory Layout

There are three branches:

* main - contains all the logic files
* data - the raw downloaded meta data files
* compiled - said data post-processing/-wrangling

It is mostly structured in this way so that the compiled branch can be git cloned individually and, during development, to look after my personal computer's solid-state drive by not having to download thousands of files.

For the data branch:

* new - target for newly downloaded video metadata and subtitles
* json - contain all each video's individual metadata
* subtitles - contain all of YouTube's automatic subtitles
* publish - where the processed data goes (temporarily as it is mostly is not committed to this branch)

Files first are downloaded to the "new" directory, then are recorded to "archive.txt", then are moved to the appropriate "json" or "subtitles" directory, then are processed into a usable format for the website index into "publish".


== Usage Notes

There are types of data to download: 1) individual video metadata and 2) the names of playlists.

. **Download step**: We employ two methods of downloading video metadata: 1) via RSS feed 2) youtube-dl's crawl of an entire channel (for a total of three download methods in the "make.sh" including playlists).
Downloads files to "new" directory.
. **Update archive.txt step**: This is file specified for youtube-dl to keep track of which vidoes to skip fetching the metadata for. This is the `make.sh mark-done` method.
Moves files to the "json" and "subtitles" directories.
. **Compile step**: `make.sh prepare-publish` (or `make.sh compile`, TODO: this separation probably needs to be cleaned up).
Build from the "json" and "subtitles" directories into the "publish" directory.
. **Publish step**: `make.sh publish` commits the "publish" directory to the "compiled" branch
