She's insisting on an irrelevant principle precluding any possible, meaningful question of whether or not a dog (or a raven, etc.) genuinely makes the decisions that it seems to make (in terms of empirical observation)… and, of course, applies this \"refutation\" of behavioral science to humans --a species that we regard with rather less detachment.  This means, in effect, \"My abstract principles from my (irrelevant) branch of the science are more meaningful than your empirical observations in your area of the sciences\" --and she shows herself, simply, to have a very poor understanding of the questions raised by philosophy in either one.  Although the video is easy to understand, I am presuming a great deal of intelligence on the part of my audience, because so much is left unstated, partly just to avoid repetition, as mentioned on-screen in the intro.

Convictions for drug sales still result in imprisonment.  But possession of drugs for personal use is no longer a crime. It is still illegal and can result in fines and other penalties, but those fines are not imposed by the courts. Instead, when a person is found in possession of an illegal drug, they are sent to the Dissuasion Commission.  … If a person simply refuses to work with the DC [Dissuasion Commission], the DC does have the ability to increase pressure. They can levy fines and if the fines are unpaid can then take the property of the user — for example, their cell phone or their stereo or their game box.

Climate change and the politics of ecology are pressing issues; sadly, some deeply immoral people have risen up as leaders, in response to that very \"pressing\" cultural context. 🤔️\nWant to comment, ask questions and chat with other viewers?

Yeah, this could have been titled, \"Why I hate vegan activism in 2019\", or just \"vegan cringe compilation\", I suppose, but it's a slightly philosophical discussion about the teenagers of Direct Action Everywhere, and the fully grown people who seem to exploit them for self-promotion. #vegancringe #veganactivism #veganism\n\nBTW, Cassie King does not have her own youtube channel, but she does have her own instagram: https://www.instagram.com/cassie_dxe/?hl=bg","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bujT4WAK36M/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLD7GymW4Epf5r_zGUzBXw8RF_Ovpg"},{"id":"AVZfdQaPUWE","upload_date":"20190814","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVZfdQaPUWE","title":"Pigs are not cute, they do not want to be your pets… #vegan #vegans #veganism","description":"Vegan activism should not be built on a lie.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AVZfdQaPUWE/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLBK9V3MN5wfumww8yZdE9W3_k0j-Q"},{"id":"09kx0ea0akA","upload_date":"20190813","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09kx0ea0akA","title":"You ARE Your Emotions: Brain Damage and the Excuse-Making Mentality.","description":"Truly, this is \"advice nobody wants to hear\". #advicenobodywantstohear #storytime #practicalphilosophy","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/09kx0ea0akA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLDnHo04yOunn-U4QXva2tOZbZiucQ"},{"id":"mOtbRiaZTcw","upload_date":"20190812","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOtbRiaZTcw","title":"A diagnosis is not an excuse: acne, emotions, hormones, true love, etc.","description":"Vegan or not, sometimes acne is JUST ACNE… and while this video is primarily about the emotional consequences of the decisions we make (and our ineluctable accountability for those decisions) it does, also, relate to the failure of the Nina and Randa Diet (\"the Clear Skin Diet\") and the general fact (stated here bluntly) that sometimes a vegan diet will even make your acne WORSE…\nSupport the creation of new content on the channel for $1 per month at Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/a_bas_le_ciel\n#advicenobodywantstohear #advice #storytime","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mOtbRiaZTcw/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLC4_FQUuJHVXWKBntjrctNJvZQOpw"},{"id":"hD5OJ4wITI8","upload_date":"20190811","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD5OJ4wITI8","title":"The Demise of British Imperialism and/or/as Canadian Nationalism","description":"In reply to a genuinely educational video (on the emergence of \"Left Wing Nationalism\" in Canada) from J.J.

A Sequel on \"Free Will\".","description":"Is there a difference between the dilation of the eye and the movement of your hand?  If you believe in determinism, you believe that there is no difference between the dilation of your eye (something involuntary: determined by cause and effect) and your choice in pointing at one thing or another on a menu with your finger.  The dilation of the pupil of the eye is indeed something involuntary and determined by cause and effect (the relative presence or absence of light) and that I cannot decide myself (I cannot choose to \"adjust\" my own eye); and there is empirically obvious contrast between this experience of something \"determined\" by cause and effect and the things we do decide, arbitrarily or not (with further categories for modes of thought both dreaming and awake).  To really believe that all the motions of your body and mind are determined in the same manner as your eye's dilation requires a belief (a faith) in something determining all your actions: it requires a belief in \"the will of god\" with the god subtracted from the equation.  It is, thus, a false religion, relying on something supernal and additional to empirical experience; and this \"something\" contradicts empirical experience; this \"something\" can neither be empirically observed (measured, verified) nor falsified (whereas the empirical contrast between the dilation of the eye and motion of the hand can be observed and falsified).  Finally, I call determinism a pseudo-philosophy because a philosophy is a problem-solving method: this dogma (religious belief) is not an attempt to solve any problem, it does not have any problem-solving value (likewise, describing the body as containing a soul (or personal identity as consisting of a soul) does not solve any problem, does not have problem-solving value).\n—————\nSupport the channel for $1 per month on Patreon… or don't… it's up to you… unless you believe there's some kind of conspiracy of contributing causes that'll make up your mind for you.  ;-)  https://www.patreon.com/a_bas_le_ciel/","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rDj8vgQzs8Y/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLCtrdP-lPCjUuWpvO4LtD6yzvRNfQ"},{"id":"CL6TXMk2nWI","upload_date":"20181119","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL6TXMk2nWI","title":"Kalel Went Back to Eating Meat: Response in Description.","description":"I think there's a lot of dishonesty on Kalel's end, and that makes this \"news\" difficult to interpret.  I've always found what she says about her university situation impossible to comprehend: various websites claim that she's been caught lying about her university education at specific times, but, in general, the whole thing just seems like a loosely improvised fabrication.  In these circumstances, it's possible that she's being dishonest on several levels, and that she set this up with lies at several different stages: perhaps she knew in advance that she would \"come out\" as a meat eater, and therefore engaged in a series of disclosures (provoking and reacting to vegan disappointment with her, \"in advance\", so to speak).\nIn talking about Kalel, we're talking about someone obsessed with her outward appearance: I genuinely lost count of the number of cosmetic surgeries she's admitted to (i.e., I tried to keep a tally when she made that video summarizing her experience with plastic surgery).\nAsk yourself this: if she'd spent a period of her life using heroin, cocaine or addicted to pain-killers, do you think she'd admit it?  If she'd spent a period of her life using performance-enhancing drugs (either in an attempt to be leaner or more muscular or more curvy —there are drugs for all of those things, used by female fitness-models, etc.), do you think she'd admit it?\nThe scope for possibly-undisclosed health factors is, thus, near-infinite, when you're looking at a confession from someone with such a propensity to deceive.\nI am somewhat psychologically burdened by my own negative experience(s) with universities, so her dishonesty on that one issue seems outstanding to me (whereas a woman lying about weight-loss is not really so surprising from my perspective).\nBut the underlying reality may really be 180 degrees the opposite of what's been presented today: maybe she just plotted a way to \"come out\" as a meat-eating bisexual (or even lesbian) and this story about her testosterone levels is the bizarre result of those machinations (and please note: she herself claimed that her testosterone levels were linked to her bisexuality/homosexuality, I don't subscribe to any such theory myself).\nAs improbable as that may sound, it is, in this scenario (of an unreliable witness), more likely than the theory that she has an obscure form of (non-PCOS) high testosterone health condition that \"requires\" her to eat red meat and chicken eggs as \"treatment\".  IMHO.\n—————\nFor the record, the direct revelation that she's now eating red meat and chicken eggs is in Kalel's video (today) titled, \"SO... APPARENTLY, I'M A MAN\".

You should be able to relate to that? Don't you thing that when the children are in kindergarden, she actually will meet, greet, organize, bake, invite non-vegan children etc.?\n\nIt was not your choice to get divorced and see your daughter only a few times a year - but yet, how would your life be with your daugher? Maybe toys, activities etc. would be more important than meeting other vegans or fight the fight for veganism while travelling around the world.\n\nI am surprised that you argue that cooperation with hunters is necessary (which I agree to), but do not accept that there might be vegans who try to reach out to non-vegans and accept reductutarians. And that it is necessary to reach the 85-95% whol won't be 100% vegen within the next ten, twenty years.\n\nYou can build a bridge as a mother of two small children.\nAny vegan who has no sympathy with people who call themelves WFPB and shy from defining themselfes \"vegan\" in public just to avoid the toxic/ignorant vegans of the Durianrider-Freelee-\"Influencer\" type is suspicious to me.\n\nShe might reach more people and convince them of reasons to be vegan - and actually stay vegan b/c she does care what she/others eat. She is Mrs.\"Well planned vegan diet\" - which is more than so many fringe guys out there are able to comprehend. Why should  she be forced to go to potlucks etc? She is not a vegan for people who are already vegan for a longer time watch nf-org etc. But she does attract the intelligent 16-year-old and the curious 60-year old in many forms, confessions and sizes.\n\nShe may not attact you or me, but she attracts enough people to make Patreon a reliable stream of revenue. \n\nYour openness towards seems to crack down as soon as they do not follow your path 100%. If someone meditates, takes antidepressants, accepts small scale animal ownership, talks to non-100%-vegans and 2-day-a-week-vegans, you're out. She does not promote that, she just talks to people  you would accuse of being weak, dumb and immoral.\n\nYou refuse to sit down with your very family when they do not refrain from animal consumption. You do that for moral reasons. But you should accept that aside from Freelee and Gary and their posse, not many people are like that. Thy meet their family, they have non-vegan friends. How else would you attract new people? Not everybody wants to loose their foreskin in order to be \"pure enough\" to be accepted inside the congregation hall.\n\nConcerning radicalness, you are closer to Yourofsky than you may like. You are the \"boxing intellectual\" kind of radical person. And I fucking like you for that, just as I like Stephen Fry & Chris Hitchens.\n\nKudos for taking down the most toxic guy on youtube. Without your courage no one would have had the guts do do that. But Vegan Cheetah, Henya, Nikokado, - I am always puzzled that you talk to such shallow people and can't make peace/discuss with UV - your disdain seems to be so strong that even if she would talk to you, there would be no result.\n\nUV is not \"on permanent vaccation\" - she has evolved from a raw vegan dogsitter to well-planned WFPB vegan mother who does her thing on yt/patreon. Huge plus - she does monetize her children, she does not even show them. She accepts that they have the right to privacy until they are old enough to decide themselves if they want to go online.\n\nYou have this strong point that your philosophical videos are excellent and your hangout-videos are great. Talk to people. Some people have to be called out. \n\nI would appreciate that you reduce the callouts of UV to substantial stuff (like the antidepressant-discussion or the palm oil/date dilemma).\n\nThis was an ad-hominem-attack with cheap tricks.\n———END QUOTE———","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mGpjzhGv0c8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLDV4qjbFArX9SVgTOTuiCyKbZpBkg"},{"id":"uGcA5C7pCt8","upload_date":"20181028","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGcA5C7pCt8","title":"\"Vegan Gains\" = GARBAGE CONTENT.","description":"Vegan Gains’s current content has zero educational value, and zero entertainment value: if I wanted to hear analysis at the level of “you’re a dumb *****”, I’d watch CNN. https://twitter.com/eiselmazard\nHere's the link to the earlier video mentioned, \"The wonder that was Freelee (RT4 in the past tense).\"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJd6wQlMW5Y","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uGcA5C7pCt8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLD7a80XtRcbMGSgfRYM8brgFfxebg"},{"id":"26vtPIfFjCE","upload_date":"20181024","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26vtPIfFjCE","title":"[還擊] \"Honest Opinion On The Vegan Community & Why I Am Not Vegan\"","description":"Support this channel for $1 per month on Patreon, or else you will have nothing to watch but makeup artists making excuses for their lifestyle choices. https://www.patreon.com/a_bas_le_ciel/\n—————\nThe video being replied to = Sarah Therese: Honest Opinion On The Vegan Community & Why I Am Not Vegan.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1fqcbhcVM0\nA day or two after my video was posted, Vegan Gains made a video of his own on the same topic, titled, \"Sarah Therese vs Vegan Gains\".

This cost me over 1000 Euros, and, also, took up two days of my seven day visit (we spent four days, in total, just riding the train, i.e., ALL DAY, back and forth, although only two of the four trips were with my daughter).  My ex-wife has never given me any reason as to why she did this to us (we booked long in advance, and included her in the decision-making as to where we'd book a home for the holiday, etc.).  But yes, we had to pack quite a lot of vegan food, and try to prepare fun and games for a very long train ride with a 4 year old: and, despite everything, it was indeed fun.  On the way back I prepared for her a chocolate-covered banana (to eat on the train) and the remains of this banana were, hilariously, received with horror by my ex-wife, who then wrote me an email accusing me of feeding my daughter nothing but chocolate bananas.  This was, indeed, hilarious, but for all I know, my daughter boasted that she ate chocolate-covered bananas every day (whereas, in fact, it was something she had twice during a 7-day trip).","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NuwpYPSZlVM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLBnIatgqpVmMn6lXbXFQ3a014J6yQ"},{"id":"ya4Q6TYCRmg","upload_date":"20180214","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya4Q6TYCRmg","title":"On Vegan Slactivism in 2018: Discussing \"the Demimonde\" with Flemface.","description":"\"Money, power, fame, sex, respect… not in that order.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/HeiJinZhengZhi/playlists\n^ There's a playlist collecting together the three parts of this conversation (with \"TheFlemface\"), and many more.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ya4Q6TYCRmg/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLARN0pcS3zZr-PuaLoR8rfdfUHZmA"},{"id":"y1X4uiUztgo","upload_date":"20180213","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1X4uiUztgo","title":"Eisel Mazard vs Flemface: Ethical Questions WITHIN Veganism.","description":"Rat infestations, domesticated animals (\"pets\")… and the strange conflicts (psychological and political) that divide vegans.\nTHIS IS PART ONE: there will be a playlist, on this channel, with all three videos from this conversation (and any future conversations/collabs with TheFlemface).

The tractable then becomes intractable, as the disputing parties struggle to apportion blame and cast aspersions on one-another, though this behavior can never give either side the reassurance they're seeking: it's a struggle for the moral high ground in which both sides feel denigrated.  In praxis, this sense of our own \"ethical identity\" shouldn't be involved in the dispute/resolution at all, and it can be removed by one side simply claiming the low ground: parting with the pretense that they are \"a good person\".

Ήμασταν ποτέ κοινότητα; Θα οργανωθούμε ποτέ να γίνουμε μια κοινότητα;\nΗ \"Unnatural Vegan\" κάνει την εξής ενδιαφέρουσα δήλωση πως δεν το κάνει για να είναι μέρος μιας κοινότητας. Δεν είναι ο σκοπός της, δεν την νοιάζει.\nΛοιπόν, έχω διαφορετική άποψη από εκείνη γι αυτό, και δεν είναι κριτική κατά της, είναι μια προσωπική διαφορά μεταξύ μας για την οποία νομίζω πως αξίζει να συζητήσω.\nΕίμαι πιο φιλόδοξος από αυτό. Είμαι πιο άπληστος από αυτό.\nΝαι, θέλω μια πραγματική κοινότητα. Κοιτάξτε τις \"Μητέρες Κατά της Οδήγησης υπό την Επήρεια Ποτού\", έχουν τουλάχιστον ένα γραφείο σε κάθε Αμερικάνικη πολιτεία.\nΥπάρχουν πενήντα πολιτείες στις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες και έχουν πάνω από πενήντα γραφεία με προσωπικό που είναι ανοιχτά όλη την ώρα.\nΕκείνοι το έχουν αυτό, εμείς όχι. Για πες μου, το 2016 ποιο μήνυμα είναι πιο σημαντικό, οι «Μητέρες Κατά της Οδήγησης υπό την Επήρεια Ποτού» ή ο βιγκανισμός... Είναι ο βιγκανισμός.\nΑκόμα και αν στο παρελθόν, στην δεκαετία του 80, υπήρχε κάποιο επιχείρημα ότι οι «Μητέρες Κατά της Οδήγησης υπό την Επήρεια Ποτού» ήταν ένα πολύ σημαντικό λόμπι. Σήμερα, ο βιγκανισμός είναι ένα μήνυμα το οποίο οπωσδήποτε χρειάζεται πενήντα γραφεία στις Ηνωμένες πολιτείες.\nΞέρεις, έζησα σε μια εποχή στην οποία είδα τις ομάδες των γκέι να εξελίσσονται από περιθωριακές σε οργανώσεις με μεγάλη επιρροή.\nΌταν ζούσα στο Τορόντο, υπήρχαν αρκετές οργανώσεις με κόσμο που δούλευε για τα δικαιώματα των γκέι,\nΘυμάμαι πως υπήρχε μια οργάνωση η οποία είχε να κάνει αποκλειστικά με τις λεσβίες... διαφορετικές οργανώσεις για όλων των ειδών τις πολιτικές οπτικές γωνίες.\nΚαι αν υπήρχε κάποια αμφισβήτηση, οι εφημερίδες πήγαιναν και έπαιρναν συνέντευξη από αυτές τις οργανώσεις, ξέρεις, ήταν μη κερδοσκοπικές πολιτικές οργανώσεις... όπως θες πες τες.\nΟπότε, ας πούμε πως ο αρχηγός της αστυνομίας έκανε ένα ομοφοβικό σχόλιο. Οι εφημερίδες πήγαιναν και έπαιρναν συνέντευξη-- \"Ας πάμε σε αυτή την ομάδα νομικής υπεράσπισης για τους γκέι και ας δούμε τι έχουν να πουν για αυτό\". Κάτι τέτοιο.\nΈτσι είναι μια πραγματική κοινότητα. Αυτή ήταν μια όψη της γκέι κοινότητας. Στο Τορόντο υπήρχε μια πραγματική γκέι κοινότητα εκείνη την εποχή.\nΕίχαν μια γειτονιά, είχαν κτίρια, είχαν γραφεία, είχαν δικηγόρους, είχαν κλαμπ, είχαν φεστιβάλ. Πολλές πόλεις δεν τα έχουν αυτά, αλλά το Τορόντο είχε πολλαπλές γκέι κοινότητες και οι εφημερίδες μπορούσαν να πάνε σε αυτές, εντάξει;\nΘα ήταν διαφορετικό αν ήμασταν στο επίπεδο των «Μητέρων Κατά της Οδήγησης υπό την Επήρεια Ποτού», θα ήταν επίσης διαφορετικό αν ήμασταν στο επίπεδο των Εβραίων στην Βρετανική Κολομβία.\nΟι Εβραίοι είναι μια μικροσκοπική μειονότητα σε αυτό το κομμάτι του Καναδά, αλλά έχουν κοινωνικές υποδομές, έχουν πραγματικές οργανώσεις, έχουν υποτροφίες και όλων των ειδών τα προνόμια από την γέννηση μέχρι τον θάνατο,\nκαι όπως και να έχει, μπορείς να πας σε ένα από τα πικ-νικ τους και να μιλήσεις με άλλους από κοντά, και αυτό, από εράνους, μέχρι φιλανθρωπική εργασία και πολλά άλλα, μπορεί να κάνει μεγάλη διαφορά.\nΤα θέλω όλα. Θέλω μια πραγματική κοινότητα και δεν βλέπω κάποιον λόγο να προσποιούμαι πως δεν το θέλω ή πως δεν θα είχε αξία για εμένα.\nΔεν βλέπω τον λόγο να προσποιούμαι πως ο βιγκανισμός μου είναι ικανοποιητικός αν είναι μόνο μια διατροφή ή κάτι που κάνω στην ιδιωτική μου ζωή που δεν έχει καμία πολιτική συνέπεια.\nΕξ αίματος είμαι Εβραίος, αλλά από θέμα πίστης είμαι Μηδενιστής Άθεος. Ωστόσο, θα με συνέφερε και εμένα και την οικογένεια μου να προσποιούμαι πως είμαι θρήσκος Εβραίος,\nτο να αρχίσω να πηγαίνω στον ναό, γιατί ο Ιουδαϊσμός εδώ στον Καναδά μπορεί να μου παρέχει μια πραγματική κοινότητα.\nΤα πάντα, από τα πικ-νικ και τα σχολεία μέχρι και τα γηροκομεία, εντάξει;\nΑπό την γέννηση μέχρι τον θάνατο, τα προνόμια μιας κοινότητας σου τα παρέχει ο Ιουδαϊσμός, σου τα παρέχει ο Μορμονισμός, σου τα παρέχουν όλων των ειδών τρελές ιδεολογίες που στηρίζονται στο να πιστεύεις σε έναν Θεό που δεν υπάρχει,\nπου στηρίζονται στο να κάνεις προσευχές που δεν θα ακουστούν από κανέναν, εκτός αν τις κάνεις στο \"YouTube\", τότε μπορεί να σε ακούσει το κοινό σου.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/faYEcXgA1lw/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLAi-FHXjKXNBKw3hD74A72VShJFxg"},{"id":"a4NxD86QHvc","upload_date":"20170310","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4NxD86QHvc","title":"Time & money, why I'm doing less and less on Youtube.","description":"The alluded-to Patreon ($1 per month): https://www.patreon.com/a_bas_le_ciel/\nThis is part of a series of videos with Tofu Goddess, find her channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/234leanna/videos","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a4NxD86QHvc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLATmG1JW4VHyKOWkc885ZlPVu8_Ig"},{"id":"d8joavtD8C4","upload_date":"20170309","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8joavtD8C4","title":"ESL: Teaching English in Asia (esp.

Here's a written summary of the current situation: 1. The donations were collected, the lawyers were paid, the paperwork was filed.  2. Initial hearings transpired, and a court-date was set (for the first major presentation of the case).  3. In the Thai system, nobody gets arrested at this stage: everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and the accused have the opportunity to prepare their defense, etc.; my own case against D.R. is not the only one that is (to my knowledge) now ongoing, and he claims that he was never informed of the charges against him in either case.  Would Durianrider tell a lie?  Perhaps.  It wouldn't be completely unprecedented.  If he's telling the truth, it doesn't really change anything.  4.  When people (incl. one journalist) have expressed skepticism about the case, I've shown them legal documents: those documents are written in Thai, but I haven't heard a single person express doubt about their authenticity.  The case is real, and ongoing.  The only people who claim otherwise have a very clear reason to misrepresent themselves --and/or a clear reason to defame me.  5. The principle of the thing is what really matters, and a large part of this video reflects on that (I hope you'll reflect on it, and how we should all conduct ourselves, in light of that principle).","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/11_V3_cUr3c/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLDIhzoefYDHBPhTjUgH1zuggr-L_Q"},{"id":"nTtQkLo9hzs","upload_date":"20161104","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTtQkLo9hzs","title":"Ecology vs. Buddhism: Seeing Politics in 10,000 Years of Context.","description":"","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nTtQkLo9hzs/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLAWnlKD8uls1_Gw3DPKLPS7wQVfVA"},{"id":"S8x09Wmx8IA","upload_date":"20161103","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8x09Wmx8IA","title":"Misinformation and \"The Movement\": Comparisons to Buddhism, Fascism and Worse.","description":"If you're interested in seeing the article alluded to around the seven minute mark, it's titled, \"The Opposite of Buddhism\" (and it's written in very plain English, as it was presented to a Cambodian audience); the particular (salacious) material alluded to is (mostly) in §8:\nhttps://medium.com/@eiselmazard/the-opposite-of-buddhism-1-a192b6880f30\n\nvegan / vegans / veganism / ecology / animal rights / activism","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S8x09Wmx8IA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLD1-5vvxJg5h3nP-6TLlurKW6-_KA"},{"id":"Udd6sK0jiOY","upload_date":"20161103","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udd6sK0jiOY","title":"Zoopolis: a NON-VEGAN Political Theory of Animal Rights","description":"This is only HALF of a book review, telling you much less than half the truth: check out the sequel, \"Veganism: what if our leaders are idiots?

I think every other point in the video is clear except this one: I just allude to their opposition to such comparative statements, and then move on to the next issue.\n\nFootnote: According to google, I'm the first person to use the word \"dissassemblism\" (at least as the name of a putative political ideology).","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GGjzkc8pqTY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLCnYEtOn3KG1AeG3tPCSXhq30L9nQ"},{"id":"eQvpjfdFAtY","upload_date":"20161029","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQvpjfdFAtY","title":"Veganism vs. Cultural Anthropology: Reply to a Patreon Supporter.","description":"You heard about this Patreon thing?  https://www.patreon.com/a_bas_le_ciel","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eQvpjfdFAtY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLDgqU10M_8I9FrlEEyh6XvF5Q1xzg"},{"id":"tITHWQtQAl0","upload_date":"20161027","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tITHWQtQAl0","title":"Vegan Cheetah vs. Durianrider: FINAL JUDGEMENT.","description":"YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO RE-UPLOAD THIS VIDEO ON YOUR OWN CHANNEL (and to monetize it, etc.) WITHOUT ALTERATION.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tITHWQtQAl0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLACfEl0HVM2VR6_LDz6nH1aTzefpw"},{"id":"CpltP4NhAIM","upload_date":"20161026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpltP4NhAIM","title":"Keeping it real: authenticity, academic integrity & the demimonde.","description":"#vegancannibals","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CpltP4NhAIM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLBQG9EOEAYLB4sFOX7FTmG5X8IKrA"},{"id":"G9skSfVHHSU","upload_date":"20161026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9skSfVHHSU","title":"Sugar & Glue: Are Vegans Really Better Than Vegetarians?","description":"A reply to a letter from one of my supporters on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/a_bas_le_ciel","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G9skSfVHHSU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLBwCaac3Cb2Y7XEEPBomsf-XHERRg"},{"id":"kThUCPno2Gg","upload_date":"20161026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kThUCPno2Gg","title":"Talking to Vegan Cheetah: Worst of the Vegan Industry.","description":"In this video, I directly tell him that he is a parasite, making money from veganism, while having a \"corrosive\" effect on the movement.\n@33:22 (Jump to this moment to get straight to the point: I explain to Cheetah why he is a fake vegan, why he is a scumbag, and how he transformed himself from being one of the most-loved (and most-widely-supported) personalities within youtube into one of the most despised.

(1) Thucydides is not mentioned: I could have spoken about Thucydides specifically, and several other ancient Greeks who have shaped (or re-enforced) my thinking on these issues.  (2) I also did not mention the experiences in childhood that initially formed this question in my mind.  When I was very small (still in grade 1, I believe) I was quite astonished to learn that there is no intrinsic difference between a plant and a weed, but that this was merely a human idea that we ascribed to (i.e., imposed onto) plants.  Many, many years later, I would read a philosopher remarking, likewise, \"The difference between plant and weed is up to me\", i.e., using the same example to illustrate the extent to which many cultural notions seem to have a biological reality, but, in fact, we can decide for ourselves whether or not a dandelion is truly worse than a rose.  That was a very simple childhood insight (that I thought about for many hours, at that early age) that never left me.  I applied it, again and again, to very simple puzzles, such as our notion that beauty is in the eye of the beholder (etc.) --and yet, of course, beauty is tremendously important to each individual beholder, and also to society as a whole.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F59Rx7uoRpo/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLAbRH9Ds7yatyiT6V4iKYu1hxvgBA"},{"id":"b1eiv0ifBh4","upload_date":"20160521","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1eiv0ifBh4","title":"Vegan Elitism?

[Source:] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/519185\n\nOn Crohn's disease in general, and with a description of the type of steroids typically used in treatment (and their side-effects, etc.):\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_Crohn's_disease\n\nSuddenly, Durianrider's more absurd advice (quoted in an earlier video) that a person getting zero exercise should be able to eat unlimited calories without gaining weight (etc.) \"makes sense\" in reference to his own, direct experience: Crohn's disease would fundamentally change the way he perceives diet, exercise, weight-gain, and how much he needs to eat to feel energetic (etc.).  His needs (and his ability to gain weight) will be radically different from those of an average/healthy person.\n\nHis experience with the disease might have given him some terrible experiences with the side-effects of cortico-steroids, and, more generally, the extent to which people suffering from the condition will have extreme changes in their (subjective) health corresponding to (sometimes minor) changes in their diet.\n\nFor someone with Crohn's disease, switching to a vegan, high-fiber diet, could indeed come as \"a revelation\", if their former diet had been aggravating their symptoms.  What he says about fatigue, having enough energy, etc., suddenly \"makes sense\" when you know that he has Crohn's disease (even though it is TERRIBLE advice for 99% of the population!).\n\nIn the video linked to below, D.R. sincerely says that eating A HUGE QUANTITY of carbs will \"cure\" chronic fatigue syndrome; from anyone else, this would just sound crazy (or stupid… certainly unscientific)… but it is actually easy to imagine how someone struggling with Crohn's disease could perceive things this way.\nhttps://youtu.be/kTgozmZCHcU?t=1m5s\n\nIf he were honest and scientifically-rigorous about it, Durianrider's experience probably could be useful for other people with Crohn's disease to learn from (and they may be the only people who really could/should eat 30 bananas per day!)… but, instead, he has been dishonest, insulting and extremely aggressive, (1) imagining himself to be miraculously cured, and (2) dismissing anyone who doesn't get results similar to his own as secretly eating hamburgers (etc.), claiming that gaining weight on his diet is \"impossible\" (etc.)… when, in reality, his perspective and experience are shaped by an extreme and incurable disease.  Sad.\n\nIt already was a strange irony that a guy who had been diagnosed with anorexia (and as an ex-drug-addict, etc.) was in his position (of leading a fad diet)… but it is even more ironic that this role is being played by someone with such a serious illness, with such a conflicted attitude toward his own illness, and who projects his own experience (struggling to eat enough to feel energetic, etc.) onto people who do not share the digestive problems (malabsorption-of-nutrients, etc.) of Crohn's disease.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1G0XoD-fNx4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLCgheJaFtpFJnPGfWyDlBRzmZk5zw"},{"id":"_B87OAENM_o","upload_date":"20160322","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B87OAENM_o","title":"80/10/10 vs 90/5/5 (Doug Graham vs. Freelee & Durianrider)","description":"Unnatural vegan on the 80/10/10 diet, and the importance of brushing your teeth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg7g8...\n\nThe earlier video alluded to on Freelee's credentials (or lack thereof): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNzElhpjgjQ\n\nQuote: \"Well, my name is Dr. Doug Graham.

Instead, the company makes a vague claim about being created from, \"poultry by-products\", and to me that suggests chicken-feathers… or, at least, a mix of chicken feathers, and whatever the cheapest by-products of the poultry industry may be that month (down on the factory-room floor).\n\nA viewer wrote in with further information, suggesting that Canada Goose is using the term \"poultry by-product\" in an even more peculiar way than my video supposes.  Although \"down\" isn't supposed to include \"poultry\", the word \"poultry\" can (in fact) be used to include ducks and geese; and this viewer reports, \"[Canada Goose specifies that] their sole supplier of down is Feather Industries Canada. If you go to the Feather Industries Web site, you can see a list of their feather products, and none of them are from chickens…\".  The link to that website is here, although I still would not regard this as a clear (legally-binding) indication that they aren't using chicken-feathers (i.e., I think the Canada Goose company would be clearer about this, if it were in their interest to be so, and for all I know Feather Industries Corp. could be shipping chicken-feathers via their Toronto warehouses, despite what's stated here): http://www.featherind.com/Product.htm\n\nAlthough they may sound like a heartless corporation, the even-more-bizarre fact is that \"Feather Industries\" is religious foundation, operated by-and-for a Hutterite colony: http://www.featherind.com/hutterite-gallery.html\n\nSome websites claim that the down is… uh… \"more ethical\" because of the religious nature of the people plucking the ducks and geese.  The opposite point-of-view is easy to imagine.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutterite\n\nSo… have we been deceived, or have we been doubly-deceived?  And does the phrase \"poultry by-product\" legitimately (and legally) mean \"duck down\", or does it mean chicken-feathers from the killing room floor?\n\nCf. the industry's (standard?) use of these terms, here: \"Down and feathers are normally obtained from goose and duck farms as a by-product of the poultry industry. Birds are not raised for their down, but rather for their meat - just as leather is a by-product of the beef industry.\"  (*Ahem*… right… just like the leather industry.) http://downmark.com/consumer_information/down_feather_quality.htm\n\nPeculiar.

It may not be the last.  You can click through to a list of the other videos here: https://www.youtube.com/user/HeiJinZhengZhi/search?query=sam+harris\n\nBelow is a reply to some questions I received, and I recognize that other people had the same (or similar) questions, so I post my comments here, for those who are interested:\n\nYeah, I could say more about it, but I tried to keep that video RELATIVELY short, given that my prior video on Sam Harris & Buddhism ran to a full hour. The short answer is: no. No, you can't \"move the goalposts\" and say, e.g., \"Well this method of ancient birth-control doesn't actually prevent pregnancy… but it has this great effect for your hair, so we're going to endorse it as medicine anyway\". Even that example, however, would be more honest than what Sam Harris does (assuming you're labeling the medicine as a hair-tonic, and not as a birth-control pill). What Harris is doing is more like simultaneously claiming all of the contradictory benefits (birth-control and shiny hair) for a number of contradictory reasons: he characterizes orthodoxy as if he had authoritative opinions on what it is (and means) --e.g., just making up his own definitions of nirvana & the philosophy-of-self out of thin air-- and he uses orthodoxy to stamp legitimacy on \"modern\" methods (from Vipassana meditation to getting high on party drugs, etc.). In short: it's a complete mess. It's worse than the blind leading the blind. It's a flaky, true-believer, cult-member pretending to be a skeptic and an atheist, and pretending to be an expert on Buddhism at the same time. It's really that bad. It's as bad as a skeptic/atheist claiming to have informed opinions on the spiritual significance of Santa Claus based on his interpretation of the Bible (i.e., Santa Claus does not appear in the Bible) --really, his work contains errors of chronology that crude, along with all the absurd redefinitions of terms he indulges in, etc. Finally, what S.H. is doing DOES NOT have legitimacy as a secular/skeptical exercise: he has been writing about Buddhism, as a true-believer in Buddhism (even if it is very much an ersatz, California-based Buddhism); he makes dogmatic claims, as in that short quotation about Buddhist scripture providing a completely scientific (and \"empirical\") description of consciousness and what to do with it (not a \"myth\"); he isn't skeptical even in establishing what the scriptures say in the first place, much less is he ever skeptical in establishing their scientific validity. As I've reflected in other videos, I don't think that Buddhist philosophy should be dismissed as mythology any more than Shakespeare should be dismissed as mythology; however, IT IS MYTHOLOGY. What the scriptures (suttanta) say about meditation really is a sort of mythology, heavily magical, and reflecting an ancient world-view (e.g., meditation can cause earthquakes, and this is explained because the world is believed to be a flat mass floating in a rather unstable situation, cosmologically speaking… any comment on how empirical and scientific this is, S.H.?). In his book, S.H. does not even show a familiarity with the range of already-existing attempts to \"scientize\" Buddhism, and their critics; he seems to be genuinely writing out of complete ignorance of Buddhist scholarship of any kind --even of scholarship in exactly the niche he's trying to occupy.

This suggests the very real possibility that the meditating students got SLIGHTLY better scores in the cognitive tests simply because they were taking SIGNIFICANTLY more time, i.e., perhaps because they were motivated to make a greater effort (i.e., as they knew they were engaged in a test to prove the efficacy of meditation, and they were selected as students who were already \"interested in\" meditation, i.e., quite likely motivated to make the effort).  This difference in \"processing speed\" (ca. 130 vs. 104 seconds) is a large gap, in contrast to the tiny difference of 10.88 vs. 10.84 in the \"forward digit span\", i.e., the measure of how well the student could remember and recite a sequence of (up to) 16 numbers.  Even this tiny difference in \"cognitive measures\" is confounded by the fact that the same test in reverse (the \"backward digit span\") had the opposite results: the meditators did worse than the non-meditators (6.58 vs. 6.72).  Although this is not a thorough critique of the report, I've already stated several good reasons as to why we might expect someone like Sam Harris to treat such findings WITH SKEPTICISM, instead of citing the article (uncritically) as evidence that \"Cultivating this quality of mind has been shown to […] improve cognitive function.\"\n\nI'm quoting Sam from here:\nhttps://www.samharris.org/blog/item/how-to-meditate\n(Title, \"How to Meditate\", by Sam Harris.)\n\nAnd the article that he's citing (and that I'm skeptical about) has its abstract here:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20363650\nTitle: \"Mindfulness meditation improves cognition: evidence of brief mental training.\"\n\nThe implications of the other numbers seem baffling, if they have any validity at all.  The score assigned for \"anger\" (using the \"Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory\") dropped from 4.0 to 1.91 for the meditating students; however, for the non-meditators (the control group) it dropped from 3.8 to 1.2.  What, really, does this prove, indicate, or even insinuate?  Is meditation actually less effective at reducing anger than listening to J.R.R. Tolkein as an audiobook?  (That's not a joke: the control group listened to The Hobbit, instead of meditating.)\n\nThe score assigned for \"confusion\" (another interesting thing to quantify) dropped from 6.92 to 5.46 for the meditators, but for the non-meditators the change was from 6.6 to only 4.88!  Again, if these numbers prove anything, should we take these as indications of the value of NOT meditating?\n\nFor the meditators, \"tension\" (however that may be quantified) dropped from 8.5 to 2.91.  For the non-meditators?  The change was from 6.28 to only 2.6.  The implications would be baffling, if we really wanted to take this seriously as evidence of… well… anything at all.  And why would we?\n\nI do not have unrealistic expectations here: not everyone can be an expert on everything, and Sam Harris is legitimately NOT an expert on Buddhism. However, everything I've seen from Sam on this subject (in writing and in podcasts) is really very shameful, and just reflects an extremely low standard of scrutiny (on Sam's part) even relative to what's readily available (via google) in terms of English-language academic scholarship on Buddhism (and/or Theravada meditation specifically).","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MmH-tma1upY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLBurTbF0GsQi2Ap6gUgvyUpRYYPjg"},{"id":"D1nHrC8Wsgs","upload_date":"20151217","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1nHrC8Wsgs","title":"FAKE VEGANS (Andy Warski & Tobias Leenaert)","description":"Why do vegans hate those who eat less meat, rather than none at all?

Currently (at the dawn of 2016), diverse voices are making directly-contradictory claims about the same facts; for example, I saw a pro-meat-industry report claiming that that Canadian beef exports to Southeast Asia will increase so dramatically that they'll offset other losses.  To discuss this sort of claim, you'd then have to ask yourself a set of (surreal but serious) questions, as to whether or not you believe that the future of Canadian agriculture is in producing meat cheaply enough to sell it to Cambodians (whereas, I note, Cambodia produces rice cheaply enough to export it to Africa, etc.).  There are also arguements circulating that attempt to \"reassure\" the industry that dairy supply-management will remain fundamentally unchanged.  There will be genuinely contradictory indicators in both projections and actual economic changes, as with any sudden reduction in trade barriers.  There are also seemingly-contradictory contrasts within government policy that can distract from fundamental changes in direction (e.g., providing subsidies to tobacco-agriculture, while at the same time heavily taxing it, and directing the public to quit smoking).  However, the simplest and most serious point is probably what I mention near the start of the video: that supposedly-ecological advocacy groups (like the Green Party itself) see their role as supporting the meat and dairy industries in opposing the TPP agreement.","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tS631Dq2JcQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLBGNBq6nanwrQY4mZRhaQwHrFVRow"},{"id":"62-xx8oQ5gs","upload_date":"20151215","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62-xx8oQ5gs","title":"From Victoria to Göttingen (Airplane, Boat, Bus, & Train)","description":"In terms of the reasons for the trip, there's a five-minute monologue (honest… just five minutes long this time) that I uploaded a few days earlier, just before getting on the airplane:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWQuZ...\n\nSpoilers: there is only one vegan restaurant in Göttingen.\n\nShout out to Lil B (#TYBG).
