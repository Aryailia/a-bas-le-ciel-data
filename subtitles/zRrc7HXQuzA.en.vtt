00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.170
Whether or not you're vegan, whether or not
you listen to hip-hop music, this video has

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:13.410
a really simple message that you can put together
in 5 or 10 seconds. Styles P is vegan, Elon

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.480
Musk is not, Sam Harris is not, Richard Dawkins
is not. You may not recognize any of the names

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.681
I just threw out there. Who is Styles P? Styles
P is a rapper, he is a hip-hop artist, he

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:35.320
is an entertainer. He is also painfully honest
in interviews about his own criminal background:

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.050
a life spent being in and out of jail, a life
spent being involved with violence and negotiating

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.750
deals through lawyers to avoid spending too
much time in jail because of that violence.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.649
I think if you watch any interview with him,
you'll get a sense of his level of education,

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.680
of the kind of background he comes out of,
and why he brings the type of energy he does

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:04.521
to his music and his career. Styles P is,
to say the least, an unpretentious guy. In

00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:09.290
terms of the excuses people make for not being
vegan, or the reasons people give to (kind

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.120
of) reproach vegans for being privileged or
representing an unattainable goal for poor,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.610
downtrodden, uneducated people, Styles P is
a really interesting counter-example. A couple

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.420
of years ago (about a year and a half ago
now, I think), I googled around for some interviews

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.390
with Styles P where he talked about being
vegan, and at that time (the interviews might

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.030
have been out of date already) he went through
a period, y'know, as he tells it, he went

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.380
through a period where he was in and out of
jail, he got out of jail, he tried being vegan,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.259
at some point he slid back and he was just
eating turkey-meat, but no other kinds of

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.570
meat. He went through a process. And still
to this day he doesn't really shout out his

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.770
veganism. I did go around, just the other
week when I googled to update my knowledge

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.770
on this there were some current interviews
where he does say he is vegan. He owns a fruit-juice

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.230
shop in addition to being a recording artist
and he is vegan in his diet. I would assume

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.269
that, like most performers, he still wears
leather, that kind of thing, so he's not really

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.760
repping the vegan cause. However, that's not
the point of this video. A guy like Styles

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.920
P, with all the disadvantages his background
brings, one of the things he said, in terms

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.209
of his own path to being vegan was that he
was on a bus one time (in the middle of a

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.049
tour, y'know, performing music) and he looked
out of the bus and he saw the cows lined up

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.620
to get slaughtered, he just happened to get
a view, through a chain-link fence. And he

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.379
just thought, "That's not right". And he started
taking steps toward being vegetarian and vegan,

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.599
as I mentioned, he didn't do it overnight.
Look, if you've never heard who Styles P is,

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.189
my point is not that he's a genius. My point
is not that he's a natural community leader.

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:10.709
It's the opposite: he's exactly the type of
guy most people disrespect or have trouble

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.279
respecting, coming out of a really troubled
background. But he put the pieces together.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:23.670
Maybe not perfectly, maybe not immediately,
but he went vegan, not just for his health,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.419
not just to lift more weight or get thinner
or whatever it was. […] Looking out the

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.420
window of a tour bus with other things on
his mind, he happened to glimpse cows going

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.040
to the slaughter and he thought, "This isn't
right, there's something I can do about it,"

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:48.400
and he started to make a change. Richard Dawkins,
scientist with a PhD, author of many books

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.729
on many subjects, lifetime of research on
animal behavior, animal intelligence, lifetime

00:03:54.729 --> 00:04:04.849
of making statements about animal cruelty,
not vegan, never even tried. Never even tried

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.079
to be vegetarian. The guy's done all these
interviews and made all these statements:

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.269
he encourages other people to be vegetarian
but he doesn't do it himself. Richard Dawkins,

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.579
people think this guy is a genius, and I don't
blame him for this, in terms of his public

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.229
life, he presents himself as a genius, he
presents himself as a community leader, as

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:31.979
a kind of atheist messiah in a lot of ways.
And that's cool. But he doesn't practice what

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:39.300
he preaches, y'know. And for a man in his
position, with his background, his education,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.210
with his money, with his leisure, it's not
hard to be vegan. It's easier for him than

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:53.350
it is for Styles P. Think about Styles P getting
out of jail and trying to put himself back

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:01.409
on a vegan diet. Richard Dawkins doesn't have
it that hard. He's not in that struggle. Richard

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.939
Dawkins, I'm sure he's got his own struggle.
He's writing an autobiography in several volumes

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:16.439
these days. It's not that struggle. Sam Harris
is another would-be 21st century philosopher,

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:22.090
leader of public opinion, makes statements
on all kinds of ethical issues. I guess you

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.000
could say he presents himself as an ethical
philosopher in our times. And that's cool.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.530
If you google for 5 seconds "Sam Harris Vegetarian",
one of the first results you're going to get

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:41.009
is Sam Harris on Youtube explaining how he
tried to be vegetarian but he failed because

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:53.770
he just didn't feel he was getting enough
protein. Sounds like an idiot. The simplest

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:03.289
explanation is that he really is an idiot.
You, Sam Harris, with your PhD and your career

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.659
and your life as an author and an intellectual,
you can't figure out a vegan diet? Styles

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:15.229
P has got it figured out, man. Styles P beat
that murder charge, beat that stabbing charge,

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.659
like, seriously, Styles P, you can look it
up, he's made public statements about this

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:30.770
whole criminal history, and all his court
cases; he doesn't even claim he's innocent.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:38.289
Styles P got it figured out, man. Sam Harris,
you gave up, you couldn't even be vegetarian,

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:48.419
let alone vegan, because you couldn't figure
out how to get enough protein. Man, why didn't

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:53.830
you apply for a research grant? If you really
can't figure it out, you have access to research

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.719
facilities. You've got research assistants
who you can send to the library to look it

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:03.560
up for you. You don't even have to do it yourself,
you can delegate that task. Sam Harris can't

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:11.999
figure it out. Styles P's got it figured out.
Arright? 2015. Okay? Elon Musk, who is Elon

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:18.199
Musk. Elon Musk is not a millionaire, he is
a billionaire. His fortune is measured in

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:25.620
the hundreds of millions of dollars, Elon
Musk has paid more money in alimony settlements

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:31.930
to his ex-wives than most millionaires will
ever earn. This is a guy who spends tens of

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:39.379
millions and hundreds of millions. Not hating
on it. Good for you, Elon Musk. What's the

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:45.069
issue he's supposed to be a leader of public
opinion in? Again, people regard him as a

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:50.800
genius, and not without reason. Self-made
millionaire, inventor, entrepreneur, technologist.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:59.919
[He's an] impressive man of learning, a captain
of industry. He's supposed to be a leader

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:07.970
on ecological issues, on global warming, on
environmental issues, on energy consumption…

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:14.610
I could paste in the still frame here, of
him taking questions from the audience and

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.220
someone asks him, "Yeah, y'know, you did all
this work on electrical cars, and these related

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.210
technologies, but isn't there something else
you could do to reduce your environmental

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:29.210
impact?" "Couldn't you change your diet?"
The question is kind of leading him on. He

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:41.550
says he tried being vegetarian, but he just
couldn't do it. Elon Musk, you've got hundreds

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:48.160
of millions to burn. Me, even when I have
money, I really don't like to waste money.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.810
For me, like, it was very hard to be vegan
in Saskatchewan where, like, the only fruits

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:59.290
and vegetables you can get are imported from
Mexico at a very high price. So the cost of

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.930
a head of broccoli, compared to the…&nbsp;the
cost is really high and the quality is really

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:09.240
low, and I'm standing there looking at it,
and, y'know, I know what it was like to live

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.320
in places like Cambodia and Thailand where
fruit and vegetables are really cheap, of

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.690
course. It's just… you know… your heart
sinks at having to spend so much money to

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:26.110
have such a poor diet as a vegan when you
live in a place like Saskatchewan. It's tough.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:31.149
Elon Musk, you're supposedly a genius, you
have hundreds of millions of dollars to burn,

00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:38.180
and you live in California. And you can't
figure it out? You can figure out how to put

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.449
a man in space (he owns a private space-exploration
company, a space-transport company, orbit

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:47.130
company, whatever you want to say). You can
figure out how to mass-manufacture electrical

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:54.610
cars, and preach that as an environmental
cause. You can't figure it out? Hey, man,

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:59.420
Styles P got it figured out. Think about it.
