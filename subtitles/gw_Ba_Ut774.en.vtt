00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.140
First!

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.210
 I am not a vegan to be a vegan or part of the vegan community.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.460
 Within the first 5 seconds, Unnatural Vegan mentioned one of the topics for what

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.470
 I'm notorious for discussing this in a straightforward and pragmatic way:

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.470
 Community!

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.039
 In the past I have filmed several videos on this subject and what the statement

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.570
 that vegans are part of a community means discussed.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.150
 Have we ever been a community?

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.140
 Will we ever manage to come up with a common denominator to form a community?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.509
 Unnatural Vegan makes the interesting statement here that she is not vegan because of the

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.260
 Community is that this is not their objective or concern.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.280
 I have a different opinion than her, but this is not a criticism of her, it's a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.810
 personal difference between the two of us that - in my opinion - one ponders

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.810
 should.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.960
 I am more ambitious when it comes to this topic.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.350
 I'm greedy when it comes to this topic.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.712
 Yes, I want a real community.

00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:56.480
 Let's take a look at the organization “Mothers Against Drunk Driving”.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.160
 Mothers against drunk driving have an office; at least one office in every US

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.160
 Country.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.250
 This organization has more than 50 offices in the United States that are fully staffed

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.950
 and are open around the clock.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.119
 This organization has all of these things.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.240
 We do not have it.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.040
 Tell me which message is more important in 2016: Mothers against drunk driving

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.150
 or veganism?

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.979
 It's clearly veganism.

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.299
 Even if the subject of "drink driving" was important in the past, in the 80s

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.210
 was - mothers against drunk driving were a pretty prominent lobby back then.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.649
 Veganism today is an issue that needs 50 offices in the US.

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.640
 You know, I really lived in a period of gay activist groups

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.920
 evolved from marginalized groups into one of the most influential groups.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.280
 While I lived in Toronto there were a number of LGBT branches that were fully occupied

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.120
 Offices that campaign for LGBT rights.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.119
 I remember a branch that only looked after lesbians; several

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.630
 different branches with different political perspectives &amp; goals.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.650
 When there was any controversy, the newspapers would go to these organizations and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.650
 interviewed them.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.760
 These were non-profit, political organizations.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.020
 What do you want to say?

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.989
 Okay, let's assume that the police chief inspector made a homophobic statement.

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.190
 The newspapers then went to the LGBT groups, the LGBT equality advocates,

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.700
 to interview them to get a comment from them.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.900
 Something like that.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.900
 This is a real community.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.060
 It's an aspect, a reflection of a real LGBT community - especially in Toronto,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.480
 at this particular time.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.040
 This community had a neighborhood, had buildings, had branches, had

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.040
 Lawyers.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.310
 It had discos, it had festivals; the LGBT community in Toronto had it all

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.310
 this.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.460
 Something like that doesn't exist in every city.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.910
 There were several vocal LGBT organizations that the newspapers could go to.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.690
 Our situation would be totally different if we [vegans] were on the same level as that

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.659
 "Mothers Against Drunk Driving" or the Jews in British Columbia.

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.049
 Jews are a very small minority in this area of ​​Canada.

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.810
 Even so, they have real institutions and real organizations.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.250
 They have real memberships and grants, all kinds of benefits, from the cradle

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.250
 to the grave.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.769
 Ultimately, you can go there, for example, for a picnic, and meet people there

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.310
 entertaining face to face.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.390
 Things like fundraising and nonprofits can make a world of difference

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.390
 do.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.450
 I want all of these things.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.670
 I want a real [vegan] community and I see no reason to pretend that

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.770
 I don't want that or that I shouldn't tell you about it.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.570
 I see no reason to pretend that veganism would be satisfactory for me

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:51.180
 if it's just a diet or something that I only do privately and not political

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.180
 Has an impact.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.090
 I am a Jew by birth, but actually I am a nihilistic atheist.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.980
 Still - for myself and my own family - I would benefit more from

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.740
 to pretend to be a religious Jew, to start attending synagogue services.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.750
 Because Judaism here in Canada can provide me with a real community

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.440
 everything included; from picnics to retirement homes.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.220
 From the cradle to the grave.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.370
 Lifelong support comes from Judaism, the Mormons, all sorts of crazy ideologies

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.560
 offered - those to a nonexistent God, to unanswered prayers [except

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.990
 you post this on YouTube and your followers will see it] based.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:47.550
 When I look at the Mormons, I think to myself, I want all of these things too.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.210
 It is a minor matter for Mormons to organize a picnic for 200 people

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.210
 take part.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.210
 For me this is not enough.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.190
 Mormons go out of their way to organize a fund raiser to help out a charitable organization

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.250
 Setting up an organization or throwing a celebration.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.280
 That's exactly what I want.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.080
 I want the vegan to have all of that.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.580
 The whole life cycle - from the cradle to the grave - worries me.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.900
 I have a 3 year old daughter whom I rarely see.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.700
 She lives in Europe and I in China.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.550
 Still, I wonder where my daughter will go to school?

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.180
 Where will she go to kindergarten?

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.970
 Which retirement home will I or my grandparents go to?

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.500
 From the cradle to the grave.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.690
 If we look at the problems in LGBT activism that activists are fighting, then

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.020
 we notice that these are constantly changing.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.730
 I think the LGBT community has had fierce battles in the recent past

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.350
 and that she can celebrate now that many of those fights have been won by her.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.320
 This is definitely the case in Canada.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.610
 In Saudi Arabia things are different.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.590
 Don't get me wrong, there are still a lot of countries where people go for basic

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.270
 LGBT rights fight.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.930
 Here in Canada we were one of the first countries to have same-sex marriage

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.930
 has legalized.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.720
 All of the legal battles surrounding LGBT equality have been here, basically all of them

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.180
 won.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.780
 The battles over veganism have only just begun.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.480
 Where is our office?

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.180
 Where is our neighborhood

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.180
 Our disco?

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.150
 Our retirement home or our kindergarten?

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.700
 I want all of this for vegans.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.240
 I'm more ambitious than Unnatural Vegan.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.490
 I am dissatisfied with what you people call community.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.440
 I'm not satisfied with a bunch of middle aged people sitting around on Facebook and

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.900
 give each other the thumbs up.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.550
 I'm also not satisfied with a bunch of teenagers on Instagram showing their butts

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.790
 Take photos in bikini and then tell everyone that you have changed the world.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.510
 None of these things are effective in my view.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.900
 I want more.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.230
 Can i have it today

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.230
 No!

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.480
 Can i have it next year

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.480
 No!

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.200
 Will I see it before I die?

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.200
 Perhaps!

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.040
 In just a few years, “Mothers Against Drunk Driving” simply took off.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.660
 What is the percentage of the people in America who care about the message of

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.540
 “Mothers Against Drunk Driving” care?

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.100
 It's a minority, it's really a very small minority of people who like that

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.100
 support an organization.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.100
 Still incredibly successful.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.550
 How many people support or donate money to Jewish temples in Canada?

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.560
 A small, small minority.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.720
 In the past we have talked about Sikhism within Canada.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.110
 All of these communities are very small religious communities.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.960
 And to come back to homosexuals: Homosexuality is not a diet and

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.730
 they don't need separate restaurants.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.060
 And yet that's exactly what they have.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.600
 There's an entire district in Toronto that has something like an LGBT restaurant,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.900
 although there is no LGBT specific food.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.320
 Vegans already have a reason to set up real institutions, to have real vegan restaurants.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.770
 I want all of this.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:56.680
 From the cradle to the grave, from the real 'temple' to lawyers and political

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.680
 Associations.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.630
 I want there to be a foundation that journalists can go to

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.510
 can when there is controversy within the government.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.510
 Perhaps even several foundations that follow this calling that work for the vegan

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:10.520
 Leverage lifestyle in government, in the newspapers, and in the streets.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.070
 Yes i want that

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.690
 And I can admit that all of this is not available to me.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:22.310
 All of this makes for a real community and we will have to work very hard to

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.360
 to achieve all of these things.
