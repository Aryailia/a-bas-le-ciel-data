00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.410
How's it going, Vegan Cheetah.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.560
I just want to say on behalf of the whole
online vegan community that we miss you so

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.560
much, and we're thinking about you.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.560
And you know what?

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.900
Life is full of these problems, and you are
definitely going to smash through this one.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.170
Hey, it's John from Vegan Health Fitness.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.010
Vegan Cheetah, we need you, mate.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.599
Who's gonna make Mark Lobliner second-guess
his ethics?

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.939
Who's gonna troll supermarket customers to
get their take on eating meat?

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.349
We need people who spice it up in this youtube
community.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.329
All the other vegan channels, they all have
their unique perspective.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.529
We need your perspective.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.539
What's going on Vegan Cheetah?

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.489
Please get off the fucking shit, A.S.A.P.,
bro.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.530
I need you, we need you, the girl at the 7-11
down the road needs you, bro.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.610
The vegan community needs you.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.379
I'm really going to miss your videos for the
while that you're gone.

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.649
But, as far as needing our support, and being
in rehab, I don't think you need it at all.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.710
I think you're a trooper, and you're going
to pull out of it just fine, like you always

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.710
do.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.640
We want you to come back, we want you to fight
the good fight, because you do it so well.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.160
I know so many white, male, human Americans,
who are victims, and it's pretty fucking pathetic.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.560
But you, as a while, male, human in America,
are not a victim.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.000
You're taking action in your life and you
wanna get better.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.930
I really, really admire and respect that.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.050
And I hope you're having fun in rehab, and
I can't wait for you to get out, like Nicole

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.690
Richie when she made her big comeback, when
she was like, "I'm back, bitches".

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:33.930
You know, there's a Vegan Cheetah shaped hole
in the vegan community, bro, and we need you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.930
back, mate.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.380
And, yeah, it's like a chair missing one of
the legs.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.730
It's like, fuck, we've only got three legs
on this chair!

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.730
Joey's gonna fall, ow!

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.730
Where's the Vegan Cheetah?

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.730
Ah!

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.730
Ah!

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.730
Stay strong, stay vegan, stay sober.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.730
You can fucking do this bro.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.600
I know for a fact that the work that you're
doing on Youtube is powerful.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.080
It cannot be measured.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.460
You got thousands of people subscribed to
you, watching your videos, and the people

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.150
that they then go on inspire, that can't be
measured.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.580
You're a tremendous asset to the community,
and I, for one, am looking forward to having

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.180
you back on Youtube, doing what you do best.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.950
And you won't step down, because people are
offended by your words.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.520
We're helping the animals on the planet.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.530
We're helping people.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.890
And there aren't enough Youtubers doing that.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.070
It doesn't surprise me, because, I'm not trying
to say that crazy people are brilliant, but

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:35.580
some of the most brilliant people on this
planet, [like] Einstein, were a little insane.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.940
Sometimes you have to go a little crazy at
some point.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.400
And we need you around.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.360
We need more strong, vegan male warriors to
represent this under-carbed starvation nation.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.640
And so we know you're gonna push through with
this rehab thing.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.180
I know you've been through far worse.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.700
And if this is the worst, and this is the
lowest, then (you know what?)

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.180
I know you're gonna push through with it.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.610
We've all had our struggles in life.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.720
And I just felt really honored that you were
so open with us about yours.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.030
I just wanted to assure you that your youtube
subscribers aren't going anywhere.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.610
And that is because you have the guts to walk
up to randoms in a grocery store, ask them

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.160
about the meat they're buying and educate
them about veganism.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.540
That is just so entertaining and it's so inspiring,
and we can't wait to have you back.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.560
We all go through this kind of shit, man.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.300
Different people, different things, but…
for me it was weed.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.300
It took me a while, bro.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.600
I remember I used to convince myself that
I wasn't even addicted to it.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.610
Even years after I stopped, I would think
about it, like, "Yeah, but now I can go back,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.610
though".

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.050
Always, bro.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.390
It's allright, bro, it's human nature.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.070
You know what to do, you just got to do it,
bro.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.590
We need you to do it, bro.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.590
Peace, man.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.690
This is a message of reckless optimism and
encouragement going out to the Vegan Cheetah.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.459
I've got the same message for him that he
gives to everyone else: quit everything that

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.200
makes you weak.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.520
Whether that's quitting meat, quitting smoking,
quitting drugs, quitting video-games or quitting

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.319
making excuses for yourself.

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.840
That's the core of the guy's message, I'm
bringing that message to you, and I'm wishing

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.840
him the best.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.040
Man, when you get out of rehab, I'm still
going to be able to bench-press more than

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.780
your candy-ass.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.729
But that doesn't stop us from making those
"Vegan Gains"… okay.

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.819
I don't have the guns like certain people,
but I'm still gonna pretend like that kind

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.259
of was, like, the right thing to say at that
moment.

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.610
I, actually, I really wrote that, look.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.509
See, "make those vegan gains".

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:38.330
I actually wrote, "Okay, no", because I knew
that it wasn't going to work in my favor.
