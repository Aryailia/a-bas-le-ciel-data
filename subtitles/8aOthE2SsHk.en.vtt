community that's kind of a but um yeah I
do<00:25:13.820><c> think</c><00:25:14.090><c> that</c><00:25:14.149><c> we</c><00:25:14.389><c> will</c><00:25:14.509><c> be</c><00:25:14.629><c> thinking</c><00:25:14.659><c> about</c>

00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:15.049 align:start position:0%
do think that we will be thinking about
 

00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:17.619 align:start position:0%
do think that we will be thinking about
the<00:25:15.639><c> again</c><00:25:16.639><c> with</c><00:25:16.820><c> neuroscience</c><00:25:17.090><c> and</c><00:25:17.480><c> things</c>

00:25:17.619 --> 00:25:17.629 align:start position:0%
the again with neuroscience and things

the again with neuroscience and things
like<00:25:17.749><c> that</c><00:25:17.809><c> I</c><00:25:17.929><c> think</c><00:25:18.019><c> we're</c><00:25:18.230><c> gonna</c><00:25:18.320><c> be</c><00:25:18.499><c> able</c><00:25:18.529><c> to</c>

00:25:18.729 --> 00:25:18.739 align:start position:0%
like that I think we're gonna be able to
 

00:25:18.739 --> 00:25:20.769 align:start position:0%
like that I think we're gonna be able to
