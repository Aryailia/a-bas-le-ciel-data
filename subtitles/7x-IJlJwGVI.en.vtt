00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:06.220
Hi, I'm vegan, my first diploma was in political
science; thinking, reading and writing about

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.030
politics has continued to be a big part of
my daily life.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.519
I'm here to talk, briefly, about the question
of the political aspirations and goals of

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.599
veganism, what I encounter both in talking
to people face-to-face, and the larger number

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.199
of people who have talked to me online.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.070
I'm going to hit three issues really quickly.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.660
The first is that many of the people I've
spoken to, who have been vegan for some time,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.750
have a sense of disappointment and frustration
because they begin with the idea that veganism

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.989
is a community, that veganism is a social
movement, and then they struggle with disappointment

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.160
in what that community and movement have and
haven't done, what standards they do and don't

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.579
live up to.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.050
I think it's much more, shall we say, liberating,
more honest and more useful to really face

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.309
up to the fact that in the western world,
in the English-speaking world, veganism is

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.149
not now and never has been a community.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.149
It could be in the future.

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.010
It could be that right now what we're working
towards is forming some of the first vegan

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.250
communities that have ever existed in western
culture, but you're setting yourself up for

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.820
disappointment if you think of veganism as
a community that already exists.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.270
What do I mean?

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.680
Well, you've got to take a reasonable standard
for what a community is supposed to be.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.800
Sikhism is a minority religion in India, and
it's an even smaller minority religion within

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.020
Canada, but the Sikh community really exists.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.510
If you go to Toronto, they have temples, they
have lawyers' offices, they have political

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.950
associations, the Sikhs are a community, even
within Toronto, and that community, although

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.080
tiny as a percentage of the population of
Canada, is still large enough that it can

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.090
be home to diverse political opinions, some
are left wing, some are right wing, some are

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.610
conservative, like any other group of human
beings, [with] all kinds of different views

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.840
on the religion itself.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.890
Of course, they have commonalities of language,
culture and history to bind them together,

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.840
they also have common interests, including
political interests, that may deepen the sense

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.860
of community that exists, fundamentally as
something defined by their religion.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.620
However, if you look around Canada, if you
look around the English-speaking world, you

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.060
are not going to find a community of vegans
that exists anywhere even to the standard

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.170
set by the Sikh immigrants who are now living
in Canada, and, actually, that's a pretty

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.790
low standard to choose for what a community
"is", to be considered one that exists.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.731
If, instead of looking at a cultural or religious
community to set your standard you were to

00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:41.390
look at a minority political party, say, the
Green Party, especially the Green Party as

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.600
it exists in Germany, well, those are substantial
political movements, even though they're very

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.140
small minorities in the different countries
they come from.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.650
Veganism has never existed at that level,
either, neither politically nor socially,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.280
nor as a cultural movement, not in the western
world.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.880
I add that caveat because, if you're living
in a country like Taiwan, there there is a

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.980
religious, cultural, historical component
to vegetarianism, and that has now extended

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.980
into a vegan community.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.650
I think you could say that a vegan community
exists in Taiwan, although even there it's

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.650
very marginal.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.920
Okay, so that's my first point done.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.190
Is it a negative point?

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.190
No.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.970
I think, actually, you'll be more positively
motivated and less often disappointed and

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.130
frustrated if you accept the fact that we're
not even at the stage of having our own community

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.950
or having our own social movement yet.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.790
Secondly, you have to recognize, that people
have gotten involved with veganism, that is,

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.520
in practice, a diet, some people get angry
when you say that, but yeah, what unifies

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.040
somebody who is a bodybuilder, an athlete
interested in veganism for health reasons,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.290
with somebody who's an anti-vivisection activist,
maybe involved in science, concerned about

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.489
cancer research and the ethics surrounding
those issues, those two people may have nothing

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.470
in common except the practice of the vegan
diet.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.599
And then again they may have nothing in common
with a third person who is mostly engaged

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.470
with ecological issues, with environmental
reasons to be vegan.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.349
And they, as three individuals, may have nothing
to do with a fourth person who is a stereotypical

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:16.930
hippie.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.150
Some of my best friends are stereotypical
hippies.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.979
In that sense, looking at veganism as a kind
of political crossroads of diverse, uncommon

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.509
interests, you're at best describing something
that has the potential to form a social movement

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:35.150
in the same way that the anti-nuclear movement
did in the 1980s.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:43.120
Back in about 1985, all over the world, there
were really strongly organized anti-nuclear-war,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.289
anti-nuclear-weapon, sometimes anti-nuclear-power
movements, in Japan, in Germany, in Canada,

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.599
in France, around the world.

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.389
They brought together people, some of whom
were left wing, some of whom were right wing,

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.650
some of whom had mostly scientific concerns,
some environmental concerns, there are parallels.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.979
But ultimately they only had one kind of practice
in common and that was their questioning of

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.159
or opposition to nuclear weapons.

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:12.629
It's very hard to form a social movement out
of a diverse group like that, let alone a

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:18.960
community in the meaningful sense that the
Sikh minority are a community in Toronto.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.070
What kind of community are we talking about?

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.430
If you're just talking about a list of people
on Facebook who give each other "thumbs up",

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.650
that's not a community, that's not a political
movement, that'sâ€¦ that's nothing.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.879
Given these first two clarifications I've
tried to set down, what now is the next step,

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.330
or the first step, for veganism in 2015?

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.639
To be honest with you, I think a really good
comparison is the historical transformation

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.550
we had in western culture in our attitude
toward cigarette smoking.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.099
Stay with me for a minute, this will make
more sense as it goes along.

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:57.089
If you were in the western world in about
1965, cigarette smoking was everywhere, and

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:00.169
it was invisible to the people who engaged
in it.

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:06.210
This invisibility now seems hilarious: if
we watch a movie or a news report from the

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.430
1960s, we're shocked to see that there's an
ashtray in the middle of the boardroom table,

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.199
that people like lawyers, meeting with government
officials have got cigarettes out, they've

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:19.150
got the ashtray, there's smoke in the air,
it just seems hilarious, because to us it's

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.659
at least informal, and of course unhealthy
and raises all kinds of other issues.

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.560
But to those people engaged in that, in that
culture, at that time, this was as normal

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.050
as breathing air.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:35.310
It was completely invisible, whether it was
in a restaurant, a meeting room, a university

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.310
cafeteria, a cafeteria within a hospital.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:42.409
If you go to any of those cafeterias today,
they're all non-smoking, but, a few decades

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:47.159
ago, it would have seemed hilarious to people
to suggest that you should ban smoking or

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.729
even that you should question it.

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:53.669
The problem when something becomes so accepted
in the culture that it's invisible is that

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.039
you have to work hard to get the point even
to get to the point where people question

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:58.039
this.

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.770
Is this necessary, is this inevitable, or
is this a significant choice?

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.720
Is this a significant choice I'm making that's
going to impact my health, my children's health,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.800
my future, my children's future?

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.449
Is there a social dimension to this?

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:16.479
Is there a sense of responsibility for the
public or those around me in my choosing to

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:18.319
be a non-smoker?

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:22.432
Is there even an awareness in my mind that
being a non-smoker is something that I have

00:07:22.432 --> 00:07:26.469
a choice to be, or is cigarette smoking just
something that goes on around me all the time

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:28.990
and nobody really notices it.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.659
Today, if you're vegan and you sit down in
a cafeteria, it's mildly horrifying to you

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:40.169
that eating meat and drinking milk is invisible
to the vast majority of people who are engaged

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:42.599
in it, all around you, every day.

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:43.990
We all deal with it.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:49.719
But that's the next step, and that's the first
step for veganism, to just achieve the awareness,

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:54.210
this is a significant choice you're making,
this is something that has consequences for

00:07:54.210 --> 00:08:00.069
you, for your health, for your society, for
the environment, for the future of your children,

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:02.610
fill in the blank.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.759
That the difference between eating meat and
not eating meat is a meaningful choice, it

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:12.530
isn't just something as inevitable and invisible
as breathing the air.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:18.830
Culturally, that's very hard to do, and the
type of transformation it brings aboutâ€¦

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.729
you can look up the statisticsâ€¦ people still
smoke cigarettes, and they still smoke in

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:27.789
large numbers, but now there's an awareness
that they're making a choice, and that awareness

00:08:27.789 --> 00:08:31.509
itself both creates pressure for people to
quit outright, for people to become non-smokers,

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:37.159
but the people who choose to continue smoking,
they're under pressure all the time to smoke

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:41.779
as little as possible, and when they indulge
in a lot of smoking, if they try to smoke

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:45.610
during a business meeting, people would at
least look at them and say, "What are you

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.000
trying to do to yourself?"

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.020
And of course there's also a dimension of,
"What are you trying to do to all of us?"

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:55.480
I'm making this video partly in response to
a guy who just posted a set of questions (very

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:01.620
earnest questions) about the role of compassion
in veganism as a political movement, asking

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.060
the question, "Shouldn't vegans be people
motivated by compassion?"

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.079
"Shouldn't this be a movement defined by compassion?"

00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:13.060
Well, the example of quitting smoking and
the cultural challenge of confronting people

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:19.180
with their obligation to at least be concerned
for their own health, if not other ideas,

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:23.050
that's useful partly because there is no role
for compassion in it.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:27.090
That's a case where there are many good reasons
to quit smoking, but nobody quits smoking

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.740
for the sake of saving the life of the tobacco
plant.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.410
So, it's kind of an instructive example to
contrast to veganism, where, of course, compassion

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:40.300
for the animals being killed is a major component
of what's going on and why it's going on.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:48.630
Nevertheless, becoming vegan, or being motivated
by compassion, that tends to be short-term.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.350
Even though many people have tear-jerking
stories about how they first learned about

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.601
veganism, how they first decided to become
vegan, they people who stay vegan and the

00:09:56.601 --> 00:10:01.079
people who remain highly motivated to be activists
or to be politically engaged in vegan related

00:10:01.079 --> 00:10:05.850
issues, that won't be motivated by short-term
compassion.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:11.310
That will instead be motivated by a bunch
of virtues that went out of fashion in the

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.430
18th century, not even the 19th or 20th century,
but the 18th century.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:26.180
Things like vigilance, steadfastness, self-discipline,
[having] an uncompromising attitude.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:31.050
Back in the 1990s, to be called uncompromising
was always an insult.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:37.270
It needn't be and it shouldn't be, but it
was, and, culturally, in the western, English-speaking

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:42.899
world, this is the sense in which veganism
can never be cool.

00:10:42.899 --> 00:10:47.770
The type of people who get involved with veganism
and stick with it, those are going to be uncompromising

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:57.639
characters, and coolness, ever since the 1990s,
at least, had to do with not caring, a certain

00:10:57.639 --> 00:11:05.310
kind of detached, irreverent, disregard for
the consequences of your actions.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.079
Veganism is always asking people, "Shouldn't
you care?"

00:11:09.079 --> 00:11:12.070
"Shouldn't you care about the consequences
of your actions?"

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:17.570
"Shouldn't you care about the consequences
for air pollution, for water pollution?"

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.829
"Shouldn't you care about the consequences
for your health?"

00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:24.690
"Shouldn't you care about the consequences
for the world your children are going to inherit?"

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:29.399
Even in cases like vivisection, [there's]
a really complicated set of consequences,

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:33.970
where you're earnestly asking people, "Shouldn't
you care?

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.690
I care."

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:42.420
That engagement doesn't look like compassion,
it doesn't sound like compassion, and, as

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:48.420
I say, you're never going to package it as
something "cool".

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:55.470
In one sense it's easy to end on a positive
note because veganism is so much better today,

00:11:55.470 --> 00:12:02.029
in 2015, than it was in 2005, and it was already
better in 2005 than it was in 1995.

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:09.580
So, yeah, as a kind of dietary sub-culture,
it has grown, and it's going to continue to

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.690
grow, and it's very easy to be optimistic
about that.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:17.170
If you were planning, for your career, to
open a vegan bakery, it's really easy to be

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.569
confident that this is how many people are
vegan today, those numbers are only going

00:12:21.569 --> 00:12:24.899
to rise, in almost any city in the world you
happen to be living in.

00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:31.769
If you think that vegans exist as a community,
ask yourself, is there a vegan daycare where

00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:32.769
you live?

00:12:32.769 --> 00:12:36.700
If you open the phone book and look under
daycares, you're probably going to find them

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.850
for different religious groups, cultural groups,
defined in different ways.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.040
You're probably going to find retirement homes,
also, defined in different ways.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.579
Well, if you have kids, and you need to put
your kid in a daycare, one of your main concerns

00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:50.850
is going to be getting vegan food for them.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.889
If you one day want to retire and you're going
to move into a retirement home, or an old

00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:58.589
age home, one of your main concerns is going
to be vegan food.

00:12:58.589 --> 00:13:03.959
So, in the next 15 years, are we going to
see those types of institutions?

00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:08.029
Are we going to see veganism really exist
as a community in bricks and mortar?

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:10.089
That, I'm less optimistic about.
