figured was we didn't realize that there
 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.409 align:start position:0%
figured was we didn't realize that there
was<00:05:12.810><c> this</c><00:05:13.220><c> physical</c><00:05:14.220><c> dependency</c><00:05:14.849><c> until</c><00:05:15.240><c> you</c>

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 align:start position:0%
was this physical dependency until you
 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.390 align:start position:0%
was this physical dependency until you
stopped<00:05:15.810><c> to</c><00:05:16.349><c> try</c><00:05:16.560><c> and</c><00:05:16.710><c> do</c><00:05:16.770><c> the</c><00:05:16.860><c> Academy</c>

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.330 align:start position:0%
stopped to try and do the Academy
and<00:05:17.550><c> then</c><00:05:18.210><c> we</c><00:05:18.570><c> tried</c><00:05:18.930><c> tapering</c><00:05:19.889><c> and</c><00:05:20.190><c> you</c>

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
and then we tried tapering and you
 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.770 align:start position:0%
and then we tried tapering and you
couldn't<00:05:20.699><c> stand</c><00:05:21.120><c> it</c><00:05:21.389><c> because</c><00:05:21.570><c> of</c><00:05:21.690><c> the</c>

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
couldn't stand it because of the
 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.870 align:start position:0%
couldn't stand it because of the
akathisia<00:05:22.229><c> and</c><00:05:22.889><c> so</c><00:05:23.280><c> we</c><00:05:23.400><c> thought</c><00:05:23.610><c> well</c><00:05:23.850><c> let's</c>

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
akathisia and so we thought well let's
 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.499 align:start position:0%
akathisia and so we thought well let's
go<00:05:24.530><c> get</c><00:05:25.530><c> some</c><00:05:25.770><c> professional</c><00:05:26.370><c> help</c><00:05:26.400><c> right</c><00:05:27.210><c> and</c>
