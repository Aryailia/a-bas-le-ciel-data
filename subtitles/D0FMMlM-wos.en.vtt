00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:05.870
I have here a really remarkable fragment of
the history of religion in China in the 20th

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:06.870
century.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.179
This is a book I probably wouldn't believe
exists if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:23.760
This is the Apotheosis of general Douglas
MacArthur.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.650
Although that may seem ridiculous at first,
the book itself explains that while Douglas

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:40.079
MacArthur was not a member of the Daoist religion
during his life, after he died he transformed

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.620
into a disembodied state, and in that state
he became a student of Daoism, he learned

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:56.690
Chinese as a language, and, um, eventually,
achieved immortality; he became a god with

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.440
a lower-case g, and, uhâ€¦ delivered a set
of revelations to the public here on earth

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:14.870
in Chinese (his sermon is, in fact, in Chinese
poetry), on the night of November 12th, 1979.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.730
So among the many things that MacArthur says
from beyond the grave here, he says, "A third

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.320
world war is unavoidable."

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.790
"Compared with the first two world wars, it
will be the most devastating."

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.080
"Nobody is capable of predicting the drastic
changes that will take place in the world's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.080
situation."

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.850
"World-wide, there will be endless wars.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.960
From these wars, fate will only allow 3 out
of every 10 human beings to escape disaster."

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:50.850
So, in, uh, versified semi-classical Chinese,
we there have, uh, a set of reflections that

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.070
you can definitely find in many science-fiction
movies, many secular sources from the same

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.220
period of time.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.030
It could not have been written ten years earlier
in history, and it could not have been written

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.650
ten years later.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.110
You know, I think it is a little bit appealing
or maybe thrilling for modern Europeans to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.610
get a hold of this type of material (this
is maybe a remarkable example), and see that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.880
in places like India and China the world of
the gods-with-a-lower-case-g continued, that

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.670
it continued to be possible for someone who
was a military leader to be elevated to becoming

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:38.390
a god; that, as in pre-Christian, Greco-Roman
antiquity, you had more of a dotted line between

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.900
the divine and the secular, between the political
and the religious, and more of a dynamic tension

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.129
and interplay between the two.

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:54.760
We talk about the history of the western world
with a very clear, dark line separating the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.100
era of polytheism (gods with a lower-case
g) from the era of monotheism, having one

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.170
god, with one hierarchy, very definitely written
with a capital letter g.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:16.380
From the East Asian perspective, there is
no convenient dividing line that way, between

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:25.080
one form of religion that has everything superstitious
and negative assigned to it, and another category

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:33.850
of religion that's presumed to be philosophical,
liberal, progressive, and a positive part

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.230
of a democratic and pluralistic society.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.910
But that really is the core of the modern,
western bias about Greco-Roman religion, [the

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.891
assumption] is exactly that it's pluralistic
and somehow linked to democracy (in ways that

00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:53.069
we don't like to think about too clearly).

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.130
The Asian attitude towards the history of
religion, while it remains open to the possibility

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.010
of a military figure being elevated into becoming
a god, while it remains open to this kind

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.420
of porous interplay between political reality,
visionary religious experience, new religious

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.030
movements, and so on, while in that sense
it remains open, there's also a much more

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.480
totalistic hostility between one category
in which all superstition exists, and one

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.850
category in which all opposition to superstition
exists.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.889
And, to some extent, I think you can see that
plays out even in how tremendously violent

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.680
Chinese communism was toward religion (also
Cambodian communism, trying to imitate Chinese

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:47.420
communism), which was indeed more totalistic
and more violent than Soviet communism, although

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.790
Soviet communism had its tremendous massacres.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.590
As with so many religious documents from so
many different eras of history, we have this

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:04.480
remarkable tension between the claims to supernatural
knowledge, being utterly transcendental, often

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:13.190
immortal, unchanging, and the all-too-human
political reality that's (of course) fleeting.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.360
It wouldn't have been written the same way
ten years later or ten years earlier.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.190
It really reflects the context both of the
preacher and of the crowd being preached to,

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.000
in this case in 1979.
