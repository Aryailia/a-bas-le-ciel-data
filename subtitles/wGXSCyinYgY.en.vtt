here yeah no that's really interesting
I<00:11:23.480><c> thought</c><00:11:24.230><c> that</c><00:11:24.380><c> was</c><00:11:24.470><c> interesting</c><00:11:24.830><c> when</c><00:11:24.920><c> you</c>

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.010 align:start position:0%
I thought that was interesting when you
 

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.170 align:start position:0%
I thought that was interesting when you

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:26.180 align:start position:0%

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.860 align:start position:0%
