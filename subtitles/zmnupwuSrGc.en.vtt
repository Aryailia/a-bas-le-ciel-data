00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:08.920
This video discusses Buddhism, the history
of ancient Buddhism, modernity, and atheist

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.830
attitudes toward the history of religion,
but I should say that I'm making this video

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.480
(from my own perspective) to discuss a flaw
I discovered in my own thinking as I grew

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.619
up —and it's a flaw that seemed to be my
own natural attitude toward religion, history

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.160
and mythology, as a consequence of the culture
I was raised in.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.800
The video also draws together several different
questions about the history of Buddhism that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.540
came up in my first few videos on Youtube.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.310
The concept of Apotheosis often seems like
the punchline to a bad joke.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.660
Although America remains a very religious
country, nobody seems to be offended by the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.500
rather sacrilegious painting on the ceiling
of the Capitol building, showing George Washington

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.050
in transition from man to god.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.770
The word seems uniquely European —and linked
to Pagan Rome— but, in fact, there are examples

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.700
from cultures with written records all over
the world.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.409
Western interpreters do apply the idea to
the religions of Asia (both thinkingly and

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:12.799
unthinkingly, I'd say).

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:19.799
Guan Gong (the man in the painting here) was
originally a mere mortal, but he was elevated

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.532
to his supernatural status many centuries
after he died.

00:01:22.532 --> 00:01:29.770
A literary character that was loosely inspired
by him developed more than just a cult following

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.069
—it became a major part of Chinese religion.

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.979
The historical figure was never a religious
leader, and never presented himself as a god;

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.139
even the literary character named after him
is an entirely secular, mortal figure; nevertheless,

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:48.880
this tradition ended up producing a publicly-worshipped
god (one of the most visible and widespread

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.719
in East Asia today).

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.909
In Western culture, we tend to think of this
as the natural progress of history —partly

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.819
just because it reflects the most popular
view of the Christian Bible.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.729
We assume that real, historical people are
elevated to the status of gods after their

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.430
deaths, and that myths both conceal and reveal
historical figures by exaggerating their exploits

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.760
in this way.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.840
Built into that approach is the unfounded
assumption that the Bible is an imperfect

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.130
record of historical events, and that the
authors thought of what they were doing (in

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.409
writing the Bible) as recording the history
of real events.

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.650
That is extremely questionable, even with
a corpus of texts as heavily researched as

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.310
the Christian Bible; and the questions become
harder to deal with when we shift to talking

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.349
about ancient Buddhist texts.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:46.410
The template for Apotheosis runs along these
lines: a normal person becomes famous somehow

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.200
(as a king, as a conqueror, or as a religious
leader... on this chart for simplicity, we

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.409
say that it's a king we're talking about),
and then the record of their all-too-human

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.499
accomplishments becomes the subject of legend.

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:04.640
The legends are embellished and exaggerated;
things that were originally real are made

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.079
to represent things that are instead ideal.

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.709
The opposite process has a name that we hear
much less often: Euhemerism.

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:21.230
Sometimes, in some cultures, abstract gods
are instead inserted into history; in other

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.860
words, myths are written to advance the false
that these gods had been historically-real

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.690
people in retrospect.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.239
Examples of Euhemerism are important, I think,
in challenging the habit of mind that looks

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.249
within myths to uncover historical persons.

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:43.209
We do have well-documented cases of entirely
abstract gods being made into false historical

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.209
figures.

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.579
We have examples of gods that began as personifications
of abstract ideals, and then were later made

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.170
to seem as if they had been real people in
their origins, embellishing the story by adding

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.519
human details.

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.900
Although it seems strange now, there were
strong motivations for authors to do this

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.599
in the ancient world: if you can connect a
widely-known god to a particular lineage,

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.380
dynasty, or location, you can, at least, have
an impact on tourism, and you could even have

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.370
an impact on politics.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.470
On the island of Crete they had the idea that
Zeus was one of their own ancient kings: a

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.100
mere mortal in his origins, and linked to
the heritage of their own royal families.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.800
You can imagine that this might be very popular
with the kings of Crete themselves, and apparently

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.420
it was popular with their followers, also.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.930
The idea itself was offensive to some Greeks
on the mainland, who continued to worship

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.360
Zeus as an immortal and abstract god, and
refused to accept him as a particular king

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.889
in a particular tomb on a particular island.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.720
Although it is alien to our modern way of
thinking about religion, this example gives

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.500
a sense of the cultural power of bringing
the gods down to earth: when he's reduced

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:05.819
to being a mortal man, Zeus may cease to be
"Zeus almighty", but he becomes our Zeus —a

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:11.470
particular Zeus, with a powerful meaning for
a particular people, place, and political

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.900
establishment.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.150
Following this pattern, it should be no surprise
that quite a few royal families claimed to

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.440
be descendants of Hercules.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.120
The example of Romulus (on the right hand
side of the screen) is fairly well-known:

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.440
it clearly shows an abstract god who who had
more and more human features added to his

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.110
cult with time, being portrayed (eventually)
as an historical figure with a date of birth

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.310
assigned to him, along with a date of death,
and so on.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.629
It would be greatly misleading to look at
any of these myths and assume that the more

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:49.919
human aspects are the original, ancient version
of the story, closer to the historical truth.

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.139
The pattern of Euhemerism reminds us that
Apotheosis is just one way of thinking about

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.490
the history of religion, and it is a pattern
that we (as modern readers) are imposing onto

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.680
mythology, rightly or wrongly.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.759
Which pattern does Herakles follow?

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:09.379
In an earlier video, I compared the myth of
Herakles to the Buddha, and pointed out how

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:15.039
extremely tempting it is to just accept the
"realistic" anecdotes about Herakles as historical

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.310
evidence, while basically ignoring whatever
seems supernatural.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.930
It's tempting, but it's really an emotional
decision rather than a rational one.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.750
When you read an anecdote that seems to resonate
with human nature, it's easy to imagine that

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.190
this is a fragment of "the real Hercules",
in contrast to other genres of mythology and

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.190
fable.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.880
However, the method doesn't make sense with
Hercules any more than it does with Shakespeare's

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.550
Hamlet.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:46.159
The character of Hamlet is very indirectly
inspired by a more ancient legend, and that

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:49.190
legend is supposed to reflect real, historical
events.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.629
However, there is absolutely no way that you
could discover the truth about those events

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:59.960
by looking within Shakespeare's script, accepting
which aspects seemed compelling to you, and

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.180
rejecting the aspects that you thought were
spurious.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.060
We can't delete the mythology from Hamlet,
to reveal history hidden underneath.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:15.080
Sadly, that is the most popular way for Europeans
to read Buddhist literature, selecting what

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.040
seems to them to be real (or at least realistic)
and then speculating on the historical implications,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.900
while ignoring evidence to the contrary, and
sometimes ignoring the genre of literature

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.669
that their selected evidence comes from.

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:32.069
I would say that the majority of people who
grew up Atheist probably believed something

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:34.669
like this about the biblical Jesus, too.

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:41.080
I grew up assuming that Moses and even storybook
characters like Robin Hood were, ultimately,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.110
indirect echoes of real people and events,
although I don't think that any of the adults

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.919
around me had any motivation to teach me to
think this way.

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:53.659
It's an assumption that we bring with us to
our reading of history, and (as I'm asking

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:58.490
in the text on-screen here) we tend to let
ourselves imagine that a skeptical reading

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.939
of mythology reveals something other than
a myth, instead of supposing that we might

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:06.750
just be discovering an earlier version of
the myth.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.020
Conversely, one interesting side-effect of
this attitude toward mythology, is that we're

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.520
always producing new mythology, through new
interpretations that fasten onto one aspect

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.120
or another of the story as "real" and "original",
rejecting the rest of the evidence.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.620
The people engaged in this kind of cultural
production may not have any faith in the religion

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:30.560
involved, and may be entirely aware that they're
producing something new (not discovering something

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.830
ancient within the texts).

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.190
I do not think that either of the examples
on-screen were men who sincerely believed

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.450
in the Christian god, but they both produced
their own versions of "the historical Jesus",

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.590
basically by highlighting some aspects of
the Bible story and then removing others.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:52.140
Both of them were motivated to make some kind
of social change in their own times, and they

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.800
were concerned with the future of the religion
(and politics), not with the past.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.770
So, of course, there was never any evidence
to support Jefferson's idea of a secularized

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:08.910
Jesus, with the supernatural aspects cut out
of the story; the whole exercise was creative,

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.630
and didn't pretend to be based on evidence.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:16.940
Likewise, Woody Guthrie's reinvention of Jesus
as an advocate for the poor was a creative

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:23.520
endeavor; it was an attempt to shape and influence
the future of the religion, without any pretense

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.300
of recovering something ancient or authentic
from the historical past.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.460
However, even when the authors involved neither
present themselves as religious leaders nor

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.450
as scholars digging up the past, the whole
exercise reflects this same pattern of thinking:

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:43.370
we look at the gods as if they're a product
of apotheosis, and we therefore look at myths

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:48.420
as if we can subtract what's superstitious
from them, to reveal something historically

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.350
real underneath.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:56.210
Although I doubt that Woody Guthrie believed
that his version of Jesus was more authentic

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:01.450
than the one commonly worshipped in America,
most religious leaders are not nearly so detached

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:06.060
and flippant about these things: it's really
very common for brand new reconstructions

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.000
of religious ideas to be asserted as more
definitive and more ancient than the versions

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.060
offered by competing sects —and they're
asserted as such with all due seriousness

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.050
and religious zeal.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:23.010
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the pattern
of Apotheosis was applied to Buddhism constantly

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:27.750
and uncritically, by both religious leaders
and scholars.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:32.501
To play devil's advocate for a moment, remember
that the ancient texts arrived in the modern

00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:35.820
era in a disorganized mess.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:42.230
Scholars both in Europe and in Asia were often
lacking any sense of which texts came first,

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:47.240
or how competing claims to being the most
ancient form of Buddhism should be weighed.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:53.670
So, it is understandable that they would treat
the texts that seemed "most human" as being

00:10:53.670 --> 00:11:01.570
more ancient than texts that treated the Buddha
as a god; however, it's understandable because

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:07.670
that's exactly what people had already been
doing with Jesus, Romulus, Hercules, and many

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.300
other examples.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.810
This pattern was so influential that terms
like "Early Buddhism" have become synonymous

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:19.640
with a non-magical Buddhism —and this version
of Buddhism is arrived at through the same

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:26.450
method used by Thomas Jefferson in his creation
of his own version of the Bible (simply, deleting

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:31.020
from the text anything that was contrary to
his own preference).

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:36.030
You'll notice that because of this prejudice,
my own, earliest videos on Youtube repeatedly

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:41.620
clarify that when I say something is more
ancient, I do not mean it is more rational,

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.520
or less magical —I am just talking about
the historical precedence of the texts.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:53.350
The third point on screen tempts me to offer
a number of anecdotes: many academics today

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.660
are now attacking everything related to "the
historical Buddha" in a really incoherent

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:02.730
way (and this is something I've discussed
in an earlier video, also).

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:09.140
Richard Gombrich told me about a very mean-spirited
peer-review he received (and this shows that

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:15.990
even famous scholars like Gombrich do face
rejection sometimes) in which the reviewer

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:22.350
claimed that any discussion of the historical
Buddha whatsoever belonged in the 19th century,

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.830
and, therefore, this new research should not
be published.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.710
Whether the people involved in these debates
wear robes or wear suits and ties, we're talking

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.710
about the intersection of religion and politics
here.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:40.610
This pattern was not confined to Europe, but
involved many Asians (monks, scholars, even

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.200
political leaders in Asia).

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.800
The cultural consequences were intense within
Buddhist Asia, in places as diverse as Sri

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.130
Lanka and Taiwan.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:55.500
It's quite wrong to pretend that the reinvention
of Buddhism, defining the historical Buddha

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:02.330
to come into line with modern interests, was
some kind of European conspiracy.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.980
Some Asian intellectuals wanted to rediscover
the historical Buddha, but more were engaged

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:12.980
in a creative re-invention of the religion
(just like Woody Guthrie or Thomas Jefferson)

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.080
and they were aware that they were doing this.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.140
Within Buddhism, also, there were already
pre-modern examples of religious leaders selecting

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:25.460
a particular fragment of text as the original,
definitive teaching of the Buddha, and then

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:31.080
dismissing or denigrating other written sources;
the founding of Nichiren Buddhism in Japan

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.230
is an extreme example of this.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:37.150
However, in some ways, the pattern we're now
discussing here is distinctive to the last

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:43.790
few centuries (it's a response to modernism,
post-colonialism, new availability of texts

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:49.230
and so on, and increasing levels of education,
and many other factors).

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:53.580
It is, I think, really inappropriate to pretend
that the Asian voices in the modernization

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:59.760
of Buddhism were passive recipients of European
influence; the two examples shown in the photographs

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.580
on-screen both had their own entrepreneurial
zeal, even if they worked with Europeans,

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.460
or sought patronage and support from Europeans.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:12.330
The successful leaders of reform movements
were not passive observers of social change

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:17.810
in their respective cultures, they were innovators
in making those changes.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.100
And innovate they did.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:26.870
The discovery of the historical Buddha (or,
his repeated rediscovery) was used to support

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:30.380
almost any modern agenda imaginable.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:36.870
If Buddhism as it actually existed was insufficiently
feminist, then somehow this would be construed

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:41.371
as a latter addition to the religion, and
the more-ancient "historical Buddha" would

00:14:41.371 --> 00:14:44.680
be argued to have supported women's equality.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.830
If Buddhism (as a religion) supported the
caste system in Sri Lanka, or if Buddhism

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:56.070
supported slavery in Thailand, this whole
edifice of what the religion was actually

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:01.031
doing could be ignored, and we could instead
turn our attention to what "the historical

00:15:01.031 --> 00:15:03.280
Buddha" supposedly said about these issues.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:10.500
I've chosen these examples to tug at your
heart-strings a little bit: nobody is interested

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:17.171
in "authenticity" if that authenticity includes
slavery, the subjugation of women, and the

00:15:17.171 --> 00:15:18.171
caste system.

00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:22.400
Nevertheless, we have to be extremely wary
of the fabrication of a whole pseudo-history

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.870
of Buddhism just to suit modern political
concerns.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.510
Many people would respond to these particular
examples by insisting that they're not 100%

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:37.530
wrong, but, of course, some Christians could
claim that Woody Guthrie's version of Jesus

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:43.110
as some kind of Socialist advocate for the
poor isn't 100% wrong, either.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:48.090
In both cases, what we're really looking at
is the construction of new myths out of old

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:52.470
ones, and it's the method of constructing
the new myth that I would say is really 100%

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:53.470
wrong.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:58.490
We can't selectively delete evidence from
ancient texts, and then pretend that we're

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.490
reading history.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:04.600
And, as it says on-screen, this type of reinterpretation
was generally done with very little sincere

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.800
interest in the historical evidence; instead,
the interpreters have had quite a lot of interest

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.790
in the political issues of their own generation.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.920
Conveniently, I've already written a long
essay dealing with the other side of this

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.580
story that I don't want to discuss here: a
small number of scholars were sincerely trying

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:27.570
to reconstruct a "proto-canon" for a "proto-religion"
in their researches into Buddhist texts.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.180
If you want to know more about that project,
you can take a look at my essay "Canon and

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.050
Reason" (now available in both Chinese and
English).

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:40.850
However, that side of the story only influence
a small number of people (frankly, people

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:46.240
like me) who aspired to do original research
on the texts.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.420
By contrast, the major modernizing movements
in Buddhism influenced millions of people,

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:56.500
with much more ad hoc ideas about what we
should imagine the origins of Buddhism to

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.500
be.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.290
So, in the 19th and 20th centuries, both of
these things were happening simultaneously:

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.290
1.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:07.699
A small number of scholars created the (false)
expectation that the most ancient form of

00:17:07.699 --> 00:17:12.189
Buddhism was about to be "rediscovered" or
"reconstructed" (in contrast to what was openly

00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:16.980
said to be the corrupt and degraded form of
the religion as it could be observed in contemporaneous,

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.059
Asian societies).

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:19.059
2.

00:17:19.059 --> 00:17:23.620
And, secondly, a much larger number of monks
and laypeople were engaged in projects to

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.389
modernize Buddhism —with everything new
asserted to be ancient.

00:17:27.389 --> 00:17:33.300
(I mean, by this, the same pattern mentioned
before, whereby the historical Buddha is supposed

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:38.539
to be a feminist, in order to challenge gender
inequality in Buddhism, and so on.)

00:17:38.539 --> 00:17:43.809
I wish I could say I was joking when I say
that this pattern could be applied to anything

00:17:43.809 --> 00:17:48.880
and everything, but there was really no limit
to its application.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.870
More than one school of psychology came to
be represented as Buddhist, various competing

00:17:53.870 --> 00:18:00.159
ideals of democracy were ascribed to the historical
Buddha, along with Socialism, Communism, and

00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:01.750
so on.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:07.710
In the context of Thailand's alternation between
democracy and dictatorship, the influential

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.539
Thai monk Buddhadasa published works arguing
that the Buddha's original teaching could

00:18:12.539 --> 00:18:17.879
support military dictatorship during one period
of time, and then instead argued that the

00:18:17.879 --> 00:18:21.200
Buddha's teaching was linked to democracy
in another.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.370
In many ways, Buddhadasa's significance in
Thailand was in helping the country catch

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:31.049
up with exactly the pattern of modernizing
Buddhism that was already well-established

00:18:31.049 --> 00:18:35.950
in Sri Lanka (the pattern of "brand new ancient
Buddhism", I've called it).

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:40.240
In the 20th century, the desire for Buddhism
to be an important part of modern debates

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:45.470
was much stronger than the interest in reconstructing
the historical reality of Buddhism's origins.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.970
This tends to be forgotten in retrospect:
the religion's openly political aspirations

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.850
(both modernizing and nationalistic) are looked
back upon as if they were a debating club

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.450
to establish historical facts.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.480
This shouldn't be too hard to sympathize with:
all of these countries had tremendous violence

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.530
and uncertainty in the 20th century, and went
through technological and social transformations

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.799
(along with rather a lot of civil war, revolution
and so on).

00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:16.480
In discussing modern Buddhism, we both have
the general and profound problem that we can

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:22.590
never arrive at historical facts by deleting
what is supernatural from mythology, but we

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:27.340
also have the politically-charged context
of the 19th and 20th centuries.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:33.840
The result was a great deal of ad hoc reinvention
of Buddhism, presented as ancient, and that

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:39.720
has been extremely influential, but never
could be supported as fact.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:45.700
When I say "extremely influential", I don't
mean that it has influenced only people who

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.679
consider themselves Buddhists.

00:19:48.679 --> 00:19:53.500
Consider that circa 50 years ago, the vast
majority of people who described themselves

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.559
as atheists were influenced by the assumption
that there was an historical Jesus (if not

00:19:57.559 --> 00:19:59.280
an historical Moses).

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:07.360
"We" assumed that the Bible contained important
historical facts, despite supernatural elements

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:12.240
and myths (and, as I just said, we tend to
take the further step of ignoring the supernatural

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.049
material, to then treat the rest of the myth
as historical evidence).

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:21.950
It is very, very difficult to challenge this
pattern of thinking, even with people who

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.960
don't believe in any religion —whether we're
talking about Buddhism or Chrisitianity as

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.899
the case may be.

00:20:27.899 --> 00:20:33.149
Today, many non-Buddhists feel very strongly
about the notion that the historical Buddha

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:36.190
never said anything about heaven or hell.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:40.240
This is a modern myth that is just as absurd
as claiming that Jesus never said anything

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.649
about demons or faith-healing...
...yet many people "believe" it...

00:20:45.649 --> 00:20:50.529
...although they do not believe in Buddhism.

00:20:50.529 --> 00:20:57.450
To be pithy about it: the notion of a secularized
Buddhism is especially influential for secular

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:04.200
people (perhaps much moreso than a secularized
Jesus, simply because Buddhism is exotic,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.830
and brings with it a more complex philosophy).

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:16.749
These modern myths are much more influential
than anything the ancient texts say, partly

00:21:16.749 --> 00:21:23.480
because they convince people to selectively
ignore the evidence of the ancient texts.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:30.499
That is profound and serious problem for Buddhism
today (both as a religion and as an area of

00:21:30.499 --> 00:21:37.350
study) and this problem has, frankly, encouraged
people to get into an ego-trip of imagining

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:43.470
that they're experts about things they're
ignorant of, simply by repeating generalizations

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.820
about the so-called historical Buddha.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:53.760
The sense of confidence that secular people
feel in these ideas is, frankly, much more

00:21:53.760 --> 00:22:00.770
shocking to me than religious conviction:
I've spoken to hundreds of people who feel

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:07.659
that they know "what the Buddha really taught",
without having read so much as a pamphlet,

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:12.860
and they're extremely dogmatic and close-minded
about it, without any participation in Buddhism

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.990
as a religion.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:20.330
This is a quotation that I presented in my
essay "The Opposite of Buddhism", and the

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:24.179
man being quoted is one of the most influential
authors in the history of Buddhism.

00:22:24.179 --> 00:22:29.389
The irony is that he is warning against the
tendency that became the dominant mode of

00:22:29.389 --> 00:22:34.919
interpreting ancient Buddhist texts, and that
he and his wife engaged in this same tendency

00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:42.450
a great deal: making up a standard of what
sort of things "the real Buddha" would say,

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:47.240
and then sifting through the mythology to
decide for oneself what is and what isn't

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.190
evidence of that historical Buddha.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:54.789
He was himself guilty of this, and his wife
(who also became an influential author on

00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:58.059
Buddhism) was even more guilty of it.

00:22:58.059 --> 00:23:02.999
This was and remains the sort of unexamined
methodological assumption that our notions

00:23:02.999 --> 00:23:06.879
of authenticity tend to rely upon.

00:23:06.879 --> 00:23:13.110
I earlier mentioned the example of Shakespeare:
a skeptical reading of Hamlet cannot reveal

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.830
to us the historical reality of Hamlet.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:22.899
On screen here, I'm suggesting Plato as another
example: we can't reveal "the real Plato"

00:23:22.899 --> 00:23:26.090
by engaging in a skeptical reading of his
texts.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:31.140
Further, what we think of as "skepticism"
here really means the imposition of modern

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:36.500
values: we're seeking out the affirmation
of modern values, with a very biased reading

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.100
of these texts, ignoring whatever contradicts
those values.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:48.379
There are many things Plato says that now
seem to be, frankly, crazy; does that mean

00:23:48.379 --> 00:23:54.240
that we should ignore whatever we now consider
crazy, to construct a more "rational" Plato?

00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:00.850
No, not at all —although Plato, like the
Buddha, has been made into a sort of flag-carrier

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:05.350
for diverse political and psychological ideas
in the modern imagination.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:10.480
The issues involved, however, are not just
the stuff of academic debates.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:15.490
This pattern is especially disturbing to me
when it's applied to meditation cults, psychological

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.570
counselling and so on.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:23.170
I made an earlier video on that subject, so
I say nothing more about it.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:28.710
However, meditation cults do impact people,
personally, to a greater extent than a cult

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:34.580
based on singing and dancing; there's an ominous
area of research here, that almost nobody

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:39.860
is willing to talk about, in understanding
how people part ways with their money, and,

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.500
often, lose their own sense of independence
and identity, in getting involved with Buddhist

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.549
meditation.

00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:53.580
Even supposedly-detached academics with PhDs
in Buddhism were, often enough, formerly cult

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.200
members, and you'll find that they rarely
want to discuss their personal history —least

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.799
of all their experience with meditation.

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:05.039
So, coming back to the main point to draw
just one positive conclusion (in these last

00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:10.999
few slides):
This lens of apotheosis presumes a proto-religion

00:25:10.999 --> 00:25:16.679
revolved around an all-too-human figure, prior
to the evidence that we have now from the

00:25:16.679 --> 00:25:22.630
extant religion, with various supernatural
and theological aspects supposedly "added

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:23.630
on".

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:29.669
The problem is precisely this assumption of
what is "added on", and what we're now subtracting

00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:31.769
in our analysis.

00:25:31.769 --> 00:25:36.559
This attitude fosters the assumption that
the religion began with attitudes that were

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:41.539
more rational and more skeptical than later
periods (although, of course, there's no evidence

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:43.159
for this).

00:25:43.159 --> 00:25:47.369
Later periods are therefore associated with
embellishment, exaggeration, superstition,

00:25:47.369 --> 00:25:52.640
etc., in contrast to the first generation
of the religion's followers.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.200
Why would this be true?

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.809
Why would the first generation of followers
be more skeptical (and less fanatical) than

00:25:58.809 --> 00:25:59.809
later generations?

00:25:59.809 --> 00:26:05.909
Well, the assumption is that people who met
these religious leaders face-to-face knew

00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:11.879
that they were merely men and not gods, and
knew that they didn't have supernatural powers.

00:26:11.879 --> 00:26:16.809
This seems plausible, but, really, it's untenable.

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:21.139
The first generation of a religion's followers
may be much more fanatical than later generations

00:26:21.139 --> 00:26:26.570
—and we have many examples of new religions
being founded in recent centuries (in recent

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:33.390
decades!), with modern people easily convincing
themselves that living people have supernatural

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:38.909
powers, or that living people are themselves
god incarnate, and so on.

00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:45.081
One of the crucial differences between mythology
and history is, simply, the intention of the

00:26:45.081 --> 00:26:46.990
author.

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:53.289
It seems to be unfashionable to discuss this,
and people jump to the conclusion that you

00:26:53.289 --> 00:26:57.980
want to discuss "intentions" in some kind
of psychologically detailed sense that can

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.570
never be known... but that's not really the
point here.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:08.499
We can know what genre and what audience an
author was writing for.

00:27:08.499 --> 00:27:11.980
Most of the time, we can clearly identify
the difference between a morality lecture

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:17.200
intended for adults, and a fable intended
for children.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:23.159
The difference between Thucycides and Aesop
is not some kind of subtle, psychological

00:27:23.159 --> 00:27:30.210
difference: it is the difference between two
genres, intended for very different audiences.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.260
Establishing the intention of the author in
this fundamental sense really is possible,

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.539
if we're willing to admit to ourselves that
the vast majority of these religious texts

00:27:37.539 --> 00:27:41.700
were not written with an interest in recording
history at all.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.919
When you bring the question of Euhemerism
into the picture, stories about the Buddha

00:27:46.919 --> 00:27:53.269
having dialogues with historical kings become
just as dubious as the stories about the Buddha

00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:59.809
having dialogues with Indra, Brahma, demons
and so on.

00:27:59.809 --> 00:28:04.119
In the same way that ancient Greeks wanted
to connect their gods to particular kings,

00:28:04.119 --> 00:28:09.990
it is easy to imagine various motivations
for authors to connect the Buddha to royal

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:18.200
families, and it is not easy to evaluate any
of these myths as historical evidence.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:23.529
If the intention of the author was not to
record history at all, we cannot look at the

00:28:23.529 --> 00:28:27.950
fables as if they were historical records.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:33.480
Although it is more plausible that a Buddhist
monk spoke to an historical king than to say

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:40.080
that he flew into heaven and spoke to Indra,
both are presented in the same genre, as very

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.639
much the same type of story.

00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:48.169
It definitely is plausible that all of these
texts could be fables invented by authors

00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:53.720
who had a very clear purpose: setting down
moral and philosophical doctrines for future

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.720
generations.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:01.830
Today, the philosophy of the Buddha is much
easier to know than the history of early Buddhism,

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:06.100
because we only have the answers to questions
that the authors of those ancient texts wanted

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.100
to answer.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.830
We have very precise evidence of what the
debates were that differentiated early Buddhist

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:19.989
philosophy from its Hindu rivals; meanwhile,
we still have open debate about what century

00:29:19.989 --> 00:29:25.009
the Buddha lived and died in —about what
language he spoke, and so on.

00:29:25.009 --> 00:29:31.559
The historical perspective is alien to religious
literature because, I think, it is essentially

00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:32.559
nihilistic.

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:37.000
When Thucycides witnessed the great plague
of Athens, he noted down all the religious

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.919
rituals that people resorted to in trying
to save their own lives, and in begging the

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:44.190
gods to help their loved-ones.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:50.499
He observed with brutal honesty that none
of those methods worked.

00:29:50.499 --> 00:29:56.200
That's the historical attitude: terrible,
tragic events happen, and they're not made

00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:01.730
to illustrate any kind of moral teaching,
they're not a parable or a fable, and, to

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.100
some extent, they don't even make sense.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:09.730
They reflect the terrible, arbitrary quality
of real life, and Thucydides is enough of

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:16.779
a nihilist to be honest about it: people die
for no good reason, people turn to religion

00:30:16.779 --> 00:30:22.940
to receive no help from it, and people ask
questions that have no good answers.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:29.720
As a religion, Buddhism puts tremendous emphasis
on suffering, disease, death, and casts an

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.879
eye on the meaninglessness of war from time
to time, also.

00:30:33.879 --> 00:30:39.059
You might think that, given these principles,
Buddhism would have produced many observations

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:43.899
of the brutality of history, comparable to
Thucydides.

00:30:43.899 --> 00:30:50.320
On the contrary, however, the religion has
never produced even one author of this kind.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:56.360
I think it's fair to say, instead, that Buddhism
has rather anti-historical attitudes, as a

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.369
consequence of its cosmology.

00:30:59.369 --> 00:31:06.149
The role of Buddhism in witnessing great plagues
has never been to say, as Thucydides did,

00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:11.489
that terrible things happened, that those
events matter in their own right (as facts

00:31:11.489 --> 00:31:16.249
of history), and that all our cultural and
religious notions were powerless against those

00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:18.200
facts.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:25.970
Instead, Buddhism retreats into a cosmology
based on karma, reincarnation, and a magical

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:32.830
cycle of worlds that come and go, in which
the ideal matters much more than anything

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.049
that's real.

00:31:35.049 --> 00:31:39.610
Even worse, Buddhism now leaves us with a
legacy of blaming the victim, insisting that

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:45.399
human suffering is the result of "bad karma"
from someone's own past actions.

00:31:45.399 --> 00:31:50.730
These attitudes are, in short, anti-historical,
and have remained as such even as attempts

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:55.210
to modernize Buddhism became deeply involved
in politics, and legitimized their political

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:59.580
claims with assertions about "the Historical
Buddha" —or about whatever they supposed

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:04.980
the most authentic and definitive form of
Buddhism to be.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:11.139
These were not problems answered by the earlier
generation of reformers and modernizers; they

00:32:11.139 --> 00:32:15.909
remain questions for the new generation to
answer, if Buddhism is going to continue to

00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:18.190
adapt at all.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:23.190
For my part, I would prefer to stand with
the tiny minority of people who are willing

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:30.700
to be honest —as Thucydides was— about
what our history is, now, as it unfolds, and

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:44.390
I do not want to be part of a culture that
values fables more than facts.
