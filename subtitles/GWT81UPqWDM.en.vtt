00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:07.779
So, if you're one of the few people who read
my article discussing my experience studying

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.809
the Cree language at First Nations University
of Canada (F.N.U.),

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.349
if you're one of the people who read that
article then you already know my experience

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:23.050
inside that university was very bad, but that
is not the answer to the question, "Why did

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.040
I stop studying Cree as a language?"

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.969
The amazing thing about the Algonquian languages
is the diversity and the [extent of the] territory

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.289
they cover.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:41.899
The furthest language to the west is Yurok,
out in California; the Algonquian languages

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.289
went all the way east to the eastern seaboard,
the east coast of Canda, and what's now New

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.579
York City.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.790
Before the British killed everyone there who
could speak the language, the indigenous language

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.799
spoken in what's now Manhattan [was] indeed
an Algonquian language.

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:06.109
So, this [language family] covered, in a complex
map, a tremendous diversity of terrain, and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:10.579
a tremendous diversity of languages and dialects.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:16.290
So the opportunity to work on Algonquian languages
was definitely not exclusive to First Nations

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.140
University.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.520
I was over 30 years old when I wanted to make
this transition in my life, and both for me

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.060
personally, and for these languages themselves,
on a bigger scale, the opportunity was very

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.329
much now-or-never.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.340
Any research you want to do on the indigenous
languages of Canada, you've got to do it now,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.530
or it's going to be never.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.790
If you want to do a preservation project,
an education project, to stop these languages

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.619
from [being] endangered, do it now, because
in 20 years it is going to be too late.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.119
If you want to get out and interview people,
elderly, retired people, who can speak the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.170
language fluently (or nearly-fluently), you've
got to do that research now.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.009
Ten years from now, they'll be dead.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:13.709
The last fluent speakers, everywhere you go,
are elderly people, and the average life-span

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.370
on a reservation is not what it is in the
comfort of Canada's big cities.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.260
You've got people living in tough conditions
now who often have had incredibly tough lives,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.070
from the cradle to the grave, and yeah, you
could make contact with people who are fluent

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.120
speakers, and they could die at 55.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.980
Life can be short when you've struggled with
the circumstances that many of Canada's First

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.340
Nations people have struggled with.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.750
Many, not all, of course; here and there,
there are exceptions.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.920
As everyone knows, part of the tragedy of
Canada's First Nations is that life can be

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.099
nasty, brutal and short, when you're an indigenous
person, living in the British Empire.

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:08.829
I'm trying not to mask my emotions here.

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.689
I wanted to spend the rest of my life working
on these political issues that I've just been

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:21.400
talking about, and the fact that one institution
couldn't deliver on its promises was not enough

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.599
to end that dream.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.099
And, in many ways, [that] was something I
had been expecting from the first day I set

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.390
foot in that institution.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.329
The scandals surrounding that institution,
and the Canadian government's threats to shut

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.319
it down, those were all in the newspapers
just around the time I signed up.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.900
Although the government had just lately backed
down from its threats and agreed to continue

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.989
funding the university.

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.099
Many of the professors had just quit, just
that month, people had walked out, maybe a

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.480
couple of months before.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.832
I met ex-professors, people who had quit on
point of principle, in the midst of that scandal.

00:03:59.832 --> 00:04:04.760
And my very first day walking into that university,
which was also the day I got off the airplane

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.300
from Asia, one of the professors I spoke to
was very honest with me and said, "Look, this

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:18.260
is an institution in crisis, don't have any
false hopes or expectations about it".

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.640
I appreciated his honesty, but, for me also,
the opportunity was now-or-never.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.040
It was urgent.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.510
I had to work hard as hell to get a new career
going in those languages, while I was still

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.310
in my early 30s, so that I could be speaking
pretty fluently by the time I got to my early

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.530
40s.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.950
That's a tremendous uphill struggle for languages
that have very few people who speak them fluently

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.450
and very few resources, and I was committed
to doing that.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.310
On paper, what I did was I enrolled as a B.A.
student, [but] of course, I already had a

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.360
B.A., but that was so that I could get into
classes right away, and I was looking at a

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.640
tremendous diversity of M.A. programs and
PhD programs, coast-to-coast.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.520
There were university programs in Quebec,
there were university programs in British

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.850
Columbia, connected to Algonquian languages
and First Nations languages.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.030
I'm not saying that any of those programs
are good; perhaps each one is a disaster in

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.080
its own special way, but certainly a diversity
of options and opportunities to look at.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:35.440
No, the very simple reason for why that career
had to end, why I had to give up on all of

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.880
my ambitions, was that the opportunity had
been created in the first place by my marriage.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.030
And it was ended by my marriage.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:51.461
When my wife decided that she wanted to quit
the job that she had in Canada, the job that

00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:56.790
created the foothold (financially and even
geographically) for me to be able to study

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.200
these languages and work toward that future,
when she made the decision that she wanted

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.590
to quit, I felt that my role was to support
her in that decision, and to work for the

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.840
future of my marriage, not for the future
of my career, or my own education.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.380
I felt that was the top priority.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:24.570
Now, it's very easy in hindsight to say that
was the wrong decision, because, today, I

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.930
am divorced.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:33.620
And, again, the intellectual and emotional
consequences of these decisions, they weren't

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:43.520
just real for me, they also had a huge impact
on my wife, and they were significant contributors...

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.910
[no,] probably the single most important contributor
to why we got divorced, were the consequences

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:58.660
--the fallout-- of the end of my career in
First Nations studies.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:05.150
Not that I personally felt there was anything
inevitable about that.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:11.520
But you view time a little bit differently
when you think you're in a marriage that's

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.940
going to last until the day you die, that's
going to last until your old age.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:23.550
Even if you've been through 5 years that were
terrible, it's easy to tell yourself, "Well,

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.730
I have to see those 5 years as one chapter
in a much longer story that's going to continue

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.670
until I'm in my 80s".

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:38.880
Even if you've just been breaking your own
heart to try to create a new career in Canada

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.740
(and to try to support my wife and marriage)
because of the sudden requirement that I leave

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.520
Asia and start a new life in Canada, and start
[with] a totally new set of linguistic and

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.400
political issues,
Uh, y'know, it's easy to convince yourself

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:02.360
that you have to see those two years as one
chapter in a long story that may go on until

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.960
you're past 80 years old.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.750
And, even looking back, what was the alternative
to supporting my wife, in her decision to

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.810
quit her job and leave Canada?

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.800
The alternative was to get divorced at that
moment.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.610
The alternative was for me to say, "No, my
education matters more, my career matters

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:28.340
more, and my commitment to First Nations languages
and peoples matters more than this marriage,

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.310
so we're getting divorced, now".

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.250
I could have done that.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:41.120
I can honestly say that option did not enter
my mind.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:47.410
And one of the reasons for that was, very
simply, that I felt grateful that that opportunity

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:55.130
had been created for me at all.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.970
This also explains why I created the Youtube
channel.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.770
This youtube channel is not to promote my
career... [end].
