00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.290
Hi, I'm vegan. If you're vegan, too, you may
have been asked questions such as, "How can

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.019
you be vegan when there are people starving
in Africa?" If you work in animal rights,

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.720
you may have been challenged with such things
as, "Why are you concerned about animal rights

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.199
when there's a civil war in Syria?" When there's
some humanitarian crisis or political crisis

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:31.259
ongoing, right now, in the world. And these
questions may be put to you in a kind of sneering,

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:39.850
insincere way, as a sort of veiled insult,
but they may also be asked quite sincerely.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.530
I grew up at a time when the fear of the atom
bomb was very real, when there were all sorts

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.500
of issues that got marginalized (put to one
side) because people were more concerned with

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.170
high-temperature extinction events, such as
thermonuclear war, [the] balance of powers

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.170
between the United States and the Soviet Union
and so on. So those distractions can be overwhelming.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.140
They can be very real. And if you know someone
who is personally, emotionally invested in

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.420
one of these disasters, whether it's Palestine
or Syria or Vietnam or Cambodia, whatever

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:27.320
the case may be, for them, subjectively, those
may be the real reasons why they're not vegan,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.520
or why they're not concerned with (for example)
ecological problems, such as global warming,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.890
pollution, toxicity, the ecological problems
that are linked to meat and dairy production,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.810
animal agriculture, and so on. So, I think
it's the sort of question that you have to

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:57.610
answer sincerely, even if the people asking
it are not being sincere. Cory McCarthy, who

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.869
is a vegan here on Youtube, he addressed this
in terms of a certain logical fallacy, and

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.090
I'm making this video partly because I actually
address the issue in terms of a very different

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.469
logical fallacy. I feel that when people are
presenting this, they're trapped in thinking,

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:25.860
"If you can't do everything, why do anything?"
That's not the name of a formal, logical fallacy,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.810
it is simply a way of thinking about things.
And, y'know, another example of this same

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.719
category of thought is when people say to
you, "Well, if some medication is not vegan

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:44.659
(some pills that you might have to take for
your health), if those contain animal products,

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:50.599
then what's the point of trying to be vegan?"
So, in other words, if you can't be 100% vegan,

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.470
why would you try to be 99% vegan? So, again,
the way of thinking there, which is (kind

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.700
of) a natural thing for human beings to do,
is to say, "Well, if, by definition, being

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.049
vegan is impossible, because (for example)
you sometimes have to get an injection, and

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.680
the medication that's being injected into
you is not entirely vegan…"(I remember that

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.989
one of the other examples was construction
materials: you know, some of the materials

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:28.569
in the walls of your house may not be vegan)
"…so, therefore, why bother at all?" Although

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.829
the people posing the question will probably
not use words quite as blunt as "Why bother

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:44.150
at all?" These are (sort of) two legs of the
same stool. Veganism can't solve all the world's

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.469
problems, and it doesn't claim to. Veganism
may not be able to resolve the Syrian Civil

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:59.549
War. So what? Quitting smoking is not going
to end the Syrian Civil War. If you're really

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:08.439
concerned about the Syrian Civil War, quit
smoking anyway. There's no overlap: one doesn't

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:14.939
preclude the other. You don't become less
able to make a positive difference in Syria

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:20.470
because you quit smoking. You want to help
refugees? Quit smoking. I'm not saying everyone

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.490
can, I'm not saying everyone will. Maybe there
are some wonderful examples of humanitarians

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.400
who are smoking cigarettes and eating meat
and helping refugees. They'd do a better job,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.080
they would have more positive impacts (for
themselves, and for the world) if they could

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.449
quit smoking, and if they could quit eating
meat. Now, in one respect, yes, being vegan

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.289
is, in this way, comparable to quitting smoking.
That's why I use it: it's a sort of reduction

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:55.780
of a complex issue to a much simpler issue.
But there are other ways in which it is very

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.750
different. I myself have done a little bit
of humanitarian work --[and] I say that not

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.660
because it was "a little bit" of work, but
because I regard the N.G.O. I was working

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:14.789
for as being just-barely-humanitarian. We
were working in so-called "Food Security".

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:23.270
That's the polite, professional term for helping
people who would starve to death not starve.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.210
Now, the other reality is, the people we're
talking about, if my agency wasn't handing

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.820
them sacks of rice, they would not have starved
to death, they would have migrated. They would

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:42.660
have gotten up and moved somewhere else, where
they could earn a living, work on a farm,

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:52.100
eat food. So, the food policy was linked to
government policy, agricultural policy, ultimately,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:06:01.401
border-enforcement and migration policy. Um…
I could say a lot more on that subject. But

00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:07.819
let me tell you, even with the sort of purest
form of intervention… so that aspect of

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:13.060
what we were doing, just directly handing
out sacks of rice [is] a very pure form of

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.889
charity, some of the other things my agency
was doing, [were] not so pure, [and] have

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:28.189
much more complicated consequences. If you
relocate 20 foreigners to a small village

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:33.470
full of "food insecure" people, full of people
who are potentially or actually starving,

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:39.599
full of people who are struggling to get enough
to eat. If those 20 foreigners are eating

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:45.540
beef and pork on a daily basis, it has an
impact on that community, and if your eyes

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:53.330
are open, you can see it. I remember I lived
in one village where the whole village killed

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.840
one pig every day. If you woke up at like
4:30 in the morning, impossibly early in the

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.180
morning, and went to the village market, there
would be just a couple of people who sold,

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:13.110
uh, local fruit there…&nbsp;you could get pineapple.
You could get rice. You could get just a few

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.499
things. I ate all the garlic in that town.
I remember, for several weeks I was able to

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:24.479
supplement my meager diet of white rice and
yellow lentils with garlic (that was imported

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.900
from China), and after a certain point in
time there was no more garlic, [in] the whole

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:42.930
town, [I] had eaten it all. But yeah, in that
town, the cows being raised for beef were

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:48.759
directly destroying the one river, the tiny
trickle of a river, that the children would

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:53.240
go to swim in, that women would go to wash
their laundry in, that people relied on for

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.060
their drinking water (people also relied on
that river for fish, they would try to kill

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:04.370
fish in it, [but there] weren't really any
fish in that river). The ecological impact,

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:11.289
the economic impact of that meat-agriculture,
and the blood and the sewage, all of the pollution,

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:18.110
and so on, is right there in your face. And
boy, I don't want to digress into it in this

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:24.069
video, I'll tell you something else, though,
the suffering of the animals was right there

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:29.449
in your face. I got to see in that village
something I'd read about, but never thought

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:37.480
I'd see myself: I got to see a calf (a baby
cow) mourning the death of its own mother.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:43.560
Miserable, miserable spectacle. And the conditions
for the cows in this village were better than

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.720
on a factory farm: they were actually running
around in a grass field, and they had free

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:54.270
range throughout the whole village, the whole
town. They were right outside my window and

00:08:54.270 --> 00:09:03.040
so on. But boy, the day they killed that calf's
mother, the calf was up all night, weeping

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.150
and crying out for its mother. And, I mean,
nobody was getting any sleep. People were

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:13.810
pretending to sleep, but this was so loud
and so mournful, this spectacle… I remember,

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.660
I wasn't getting any sleep anyway, so I got
up and walked around and I witnessed what

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:24.290
this calf was doing. And it was actually pushing
down fences and rooting through all kinds

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:30.300
of barriers, desperately looking for its mother,
anywhere. And among the other things that

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:36.900
made this so surreal, the human beings were
trying to ignore this, [although] the noise

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:45.840
this calf was making was so loud that really
it was impossible to ignore, but you could

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.890
see the reaction of the other cows, too. The
adult cattle, they'd been through this before.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:10:00.130
Y'know, they knew the deal. And eventually,
after hours and hours of screaming and wailing,

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:06.640
I remember there were two adult cows (who
were not the cow's mother) that just sort

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.540
of said "Come here and join us in this shed",
and, y'know, the calf gave up. The calf had

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:18.660
searched the entire town, and realized it
wasn't going to find its mother anywhere.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:26.590
Because its mother was nowhere. People who
grow up in the countryside are supposed to

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:38.570
be brutal and heartless about killing animals,
but, on the contrary, I saw tremendous cowardice,

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:44.370
tremendously evasive attitude to the reality
of the violence and the suffering and the

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.950
filth of it all. That even people who grew
up in those villages and had slit the animals'

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:57.820
throats a hundred times would be squeamish
about breaking a chicken's neck, and I saw

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:04.640
all of these animals being killed. And I saw
some more exotic animals [being killed, too],

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:13.540
a giant python, very memorably, and something
like a small mountain-lion, I don't know what

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:20.630
species it was, some Southeast Asian jungle-cat,
while the last of the jungle was being cut

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:32.180
down. So, look, even if you really were directly
doing humanitarian work, whether it's in Syria

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:39.410
or in Southeast Asia or anywhere else, yes,
it still makes an ethical difference, and

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:45.480
it may, in a sense, make more of an ethical
difference, because the impacts you're having

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.411
in eating meat are not somewhere far away
in a factory in a first-world country, they're

00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:58.980
right there in the community you're supposedly
trying to help. And, on the other hand, as

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:06.920
with quitting smoking, which is more of a
morally-neutral example, there is simply no

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:13.790
substitution between these two things: if
you sincerely are concerned about the Syrian

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:21.190
Civil War, there's no sense in which there's
an obstruction or preclusion between that

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:26.680
and being vegan. I heard a Taiwanese professor
give a lecture on this, in which she said

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:32.070
that was the number one problem she ran into,
people saying to her, "How can you be concerned

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.980
about animal rights?" (And she wasn't just
concerned about veganism, she was concerned

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:41.230
about the treatment of stray dogs, and some
other things.) "How can you be concerned about

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:48.600
animal rights when we have all of these problems
with human rights?" And she said, "The reality

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:57.080
is there will always be problems with human
rights, so if you are saying that animal rights

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:02.530
are a lower priority than human rights, then
that means animal rights will never be addressed,

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.380
because there will never be a time when all
human rights problems will be resolved (and

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:11.120
you can then turn to your second priority
of animal rights)." It's an interesting way

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:21.390
to phrase it. But the other categorical difference
is that veganism is an attainable goal. It's

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:27.250
something you can do, now. You can accomplish
it today. You can sustain it for the rest

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:34.740
of your life. And you can have the satisfaction
of doing that. Right now, in the year 2015,

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.950
I don't know when the Syrian Civil War is
going to end. If I chose to devote the next

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:45.521
10 years of my life to trying to help people
in Syria, 10 years might not be enough. It

00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:51.340
might not be resolved within my lifetime.
Civil wars can go on for a long time. Look

00:13:51.340 --> 00:14:00.940
at Cambodia. At any stage… I won't digress
into it. That's not an easy call to make.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:08.190
Also, political problems are complicated.
You think you're doing the right thing in

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.310
Syria, maybe you think you're supporting the
right side, and maybe later on you find out

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:19.170
[that] you were making things worse, not better.
Maybe the outcomes, even though you had good

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.190
intentions, turn out to be negative. Political
problems, human rights problems, are like

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:28.010
that. Even the humanitarian work I've just
mentioned: we think we're helping people by

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:33.310
handing out sacks of rice, are we really?
Doing the research on that, outcome analysis,

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:38.740
that's tricky. The other things we were doing
with that humanitarian agency, helping to

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.690
reform agriculture, to modernize agriculture
(again, supposedly to prevent starvation,

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:51.541
to improve food-security), [that's] morally
complicated. Complicated outcomes. Sometimes

00:14:51.541 --> 00:14:56.370
you're trying to make people wealthier and
you end up making them poorer. Sometimes the

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.990
project fails, the outcomes weren't what you
think they were. And even when they do succeed…

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:07.360
I remember one of the villages I was in, I
was there with my boss, and he was just commenting

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.740
casually, there were two different ethnic
groups, two different tribal groups, living

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:16.040
right next to each-other, and he was just
commenting casually, "Oh, well, that other

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:21.440
tribal group, they're too poor and backwards
for us to work with them, so we work with

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.090
helping this tribal group, even though they're
wealthier, to [help them] get out of poverty,

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:29.360
because they're more organized and they can
take advantage of this type of humanitarian

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.730
assistance." And, y'know, he mentioned this
to me, some of these people were standing

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:40.800
around, they couldn't understand us speaking
in English, but the real, invidious, racial

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:46.760
hatred and jealousy between the two groups,
was obvious even while I was standing there.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:53.020
I learned even more about it later, but the
fact that we as a charity were making this

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:58.371
[division] worse by helping one ethnic group,
and not helping the other ethnic group, that's

00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:07.270
going to have consequences. And those consequences
will be complicated. Veganism is not like

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:17.140
that. Amazingly, like quitting smoking, there's
nothing bad about it, you don't lose anything.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:22.810
Quitting smoking you don't help the tobacco
plants. Simply removing yourself from the

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:29.730
whole equation of animal agriculture is a
positive thing with positive outcomes, but

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:37.650
also with no unforeseen outcomes. If you've
been following the Arab Spring and the Syrian

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:44.790
Civil War, at several stages the United States
was tentatively trying to choose which side

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:52.360
they were going to support, which militias
were moderately pro-democracy, or represented

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:58.480
a less extreme form of Islam. And guess what?
Some of the guns that they put into the hands

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.230
of their so-called allies have ended up in
the hands of the Islamic State. Everybody

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:09.449
knows it. If you're old enough, you can remember
a time when the Taliban were an American client

00:17:09.449 --> 00:17:13.240
army, when the United States supported the
Taliban. If you're old enough, you can remember

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.069
a time when the United States supported Pol
Pot and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. And I've

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:24.730
done the research: I can understand, and I
can even sympathize a little bit, with why

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:29.540
the United States made that decision. "Seemed
like a good idea at the time!" You look back

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:34.370
a few decades later and think, "Boy, the United
States has blood on its hands from supporting

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:41.240
the wrong side, and perpetuating a terrible
conflict, and so on and so forth." We use

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:47.660
this word "rights", and it makes things sound
simple. You're in a struggle for human rights,

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:58.780
you're in a struggle for democracy. Complicated.
Veganism is exponentially simpler than human

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:05.991
rights. It's exponentially simpler even than
animal rights. We can know the outcomes, we

00:18:05.991 --> 00:18:11.140
can know we're doing something positive for
ourselves, [and] something positive for others.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:23.040
And you can do that today. And even if you
can't do everything, you can do something.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:31.870
You can do this. It's not in your power to
close down a slaughterhouse. It's not in your

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:38.610
power close down a laboratory that's torturing
monkeys to death just to try to invent a slightly

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.930
redder shade of lipstick. And it is definitely
not in your power to decide the outcome of

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:53.150
the Syrian Civil War. But it is in your power
to stop eating meat, to stop drinking milk,

00:18:53.150 --> 00:19:01.860
to stop wearing leather. So, the reality is
that the strongest argument for veganism is

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.560
the exact opposite of this fallacy (that because
you can't be perfect, because you can't do

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.940
everything, you can't do anything). You can
do something, you can do this. This is a positive

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:17.090
change you can make now, and in a sense you
don't have to sacrifice anything to do it.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:21.520
You don't have to sacrifice your humanitarian
interest in the Syrian Civil War, if that's

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.230
what turns your crank, and you don't have
to sacrifice your humantiarian interest in

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:32.180
Laos or Cambodia, or [any of the] crazy stuff
I cared about for so long. You can do it all.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:39.090
And if you're wondering, by the way, this
scarf is not a Palestinian scarf, and it's

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:44.420
not a middle-eastern scarf at all. This is
a traditional, Cambodian scarf called a krama.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:50.001
This is what we wore in Cambodia. And, um,
you wore a red one, back in the old days of

00:19:50.001 --> 00:19:54.580
the civil war, to show that you were pro-Communist,
and you wore a blue one to show that you were

00:19:54.580 --> 00:20:00.170
anti-Communist. So the whole time that I was
in Cambodia, I would wear Cambodian scarves,

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.860
and I would make it a point to make sure that
my color showed that I was on the side of

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:09.230
"democracy and human rights", whatever that
means.
