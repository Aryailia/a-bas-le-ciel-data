makes no sense but it we better yeah so
 

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
makes no sense but it we better yeah so
we<00:18:48.990><c> have</c><00:18:49.080><c> two</c><00:18:49.200><c> examples</c><00:18:49.470><c> of</c><00:18:49.679><c> this</c><00:18:49.770><c> but</c><00:18:49.950><c> it</c>

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.010 align:start position:0%
we have two examples of this but it

00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
would be better to have a plot that I
 

00:18:51.059 --> 00:18:52.549 align:start position:0%
would be better to have a plot that I

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
should make sense right so you have
 

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:55.220 align:start position:0%
should make sense right so you have
