00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.299
you ever see that worms the hey mobile sometimes sometimes they want that

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:15.059
 sometimes they climb up the grass sometimes they swarm on top of one

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.740
 mud puddle do you think they use the sun just like us

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.010
 moon and clouds wanna see I don't know you think the birds

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.020
 looking down could ever see the underground world like the

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.109
 sometimes worms that see them see the same sky every day

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:42.149
 she imagined there is another world below where the forms are

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.140
 flying down while sitting on streetlamps

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.420
 looking she imagined hearing me sitting on their own lantern poles and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.139
 looking up from an upside-down world

00:00:55.139 --> 00:01:00.120
 do you think that when birds fly over a lake, birds want the underwater world

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.519
 see as the visscherie see she imagined himself under water and others

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.400
 sun and moon are all the fish can see in the sky they see the sun the moon

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.450
 and the clouds so she imagined the fishes

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.130
 have their own world with their own sun at the bottom of the lake

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.360
 I imagine when the fish come to the surface

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.610
 what do they expect to see some seaweed and and octoplus that comes along in one

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.590
 other ocean upside down above them in the sky

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.710
 yes i think it is worms want to see the sky and birds want the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.450
 see underground world and fish want to see a different ocean in the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.160
 clouds and the pigs and the cows then what do you mean i think cows the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.410
 want to see heaven but they are living in millions of cows their entire lives

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.810
 factories make milk and never see heaven i often think it is heaven

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.539
 but millions of them in the factories are in and out their whole lives

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.950
 waited for their death as looking up

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.480
 see are only a metal roof and when they look down they see

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.700
 only a concrete floor maybe she imagined the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.270
 world outside has only a metal roof

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.480
 and the forests and fields are made of cement and steel

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.830
 even the worms want to see heaven
