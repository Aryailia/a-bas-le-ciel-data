00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 align:start position:0%
different from last year or now I can
 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
different from last year or now I can

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 align:start position:0%
remember about three years ago they had
 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.870 align:start position:0%
remember about three years ago they had
a<00:01:09.720><c> recipe</c><00:01:10.110><c> that</c><00:01:10.229><c> really</c><00:01:10.650><c> worked</c><00:01:10.890><c> for</c><00:01:11.010><c> me</c><00:01:11.159><c> but</c>

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
a recipe that really worked for me but
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.550 align:start position:0%
a recipe that really worked for me but
just<00:01:12.119><c> before</c><00:01:12.390><c> that</c><00:01:12.869><c> it</c><00:01:13.080><c> was</c><00:01:13.170><c> completely</c>

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
just before that it was completely

just before that it was completely

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 align:start position:0%
different they made a big change this is
 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.850 align:start position:0%
different they made a big change this is
a<00:01:15.600><c> protein</c><00:01:15.869><c> supplement</c><00:01:16.110><c> that</c><00:01:16.409><c> actually</c><00:01:16.710><c> used</c>

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
a protein supplement that actually used

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
to be hemp based so I'm guessing that
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.810 align:start position:0%
to be hemp based so I'm guessing that
was<00:01:18.840><c> like</c><00:01:19.049><c> four</c><00:01:19.350><c> years</c><00:01:19.380><c> ago</c><00:01:19.619><c> now</c><00:01:19.830><c> then</c><00:01:20.640><c> they</c>

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 align:start position:0%
was like four years ago now then they

and<00:09:46.710><c> what</c><00:09:47.310><c> and</c><00:09:47.910><c> again</c><00:09:48.060><c> you</c><00:09:48.330><c> could</c><00:09:48.480><c> from</c><00:09:48.780><c> the</c>

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:57.630 align:start position:0%
yellow pea kernel protein isolate is the
 

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
yellow pea kernel protein isolate is the

00:09:59.960 --> 00:09:59.970 align:start position:0%
number one ingredient but it has some
 

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%

brown<00:10:00.510><c> rice</c><00:10:00.540><c> protein</c><00:10:01.580><c> so</c><00:10:02.580><c> oh</c><00:10:02.880><c> it</c><00:10:03.060><c> has</c><00:10:03.180><c> some</c>

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:03.450 align:start position:0%
brown rice protein so oh it has some
 

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
brown rice protein so oh it has some
potato<00:10:03.840><c> tuber</c><00:10:04.290><c> protein</c><00:10:04.830><c> so</c><00:10:05.310><c> again</c><00:10:05.490><c> it's</c><00:10:05.610><c> a</c><00:10:05.670><c> mix</c>

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:05.970 align:start position:0%
potato tuber protein so again it's a mix
 

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.900 align:start position:0%
potato tuber protein so again it's a mix
of<00:10:06.210><c> vegan</c><00:10:06.510><c> protein</c><00:10:06.720><c> sources</c><00:10:07.520><c> this</c><00:10:08.520><c> one</c><00:10:08.760><c> works</c>

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:08.910 align:start position:0%
of vegan protein sources this one works
 

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
