00:00:00.386 --> 00:00:05.888
First, I’m not vegan to be vegan or part of a community.

00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:11.986
 Within 5 seconds, Unnatural Vegan mentions the topic you are talking about

00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:20.182
 in an open straight and down to earth tone I might be notorious: community.

00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:24.663
 I have made several videos where I talk about what it means

00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:27.505
 say ‘vegans are a community’, have we ever been or

00:00:27.505 --> 00:00:29.512
 will we ever be a community?

00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:35.293
 Unnatural Vegan states that community is not a significant factor for him

00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:39.599
 it is not his goal or concern.

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:44.824
 I deviate from him on that point, and it’s not a critique of him, but

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:50.529
 a personal difference that I believe is worth considering. I will strive for more.

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:54.245
 I am greedy, I want to correct the Community.

00:00:54.245 --> 00:01:01.591
 The Mothers Against Drunk Driving community has at least one office in each

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:05.650
 In the US state, the US has 50 states, they have more than 50

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.935
 a functioning and open office, they have them, we don’t.

00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:14.714
 Tell me: in 2016, which is the more important message

00:01:14.714 --> 00:01:17.183
 Mothers Against Drunk Driving or Veganism?

00:01:17.183 --> 00:01:18.465
 The answer is veganism.

00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:22.652
 Although still in the 1980s there was a dispute where

00:01:22.652 --> 00:01:28.530
 MADD was an important lobbyist, today veganism is a message that

00:01:28.532 --> 00:01:32.696
 indeed needs 50 offices in the United States.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:38.821
 I lived through a time when sexual minorities rose

00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:41.354
 from peripheral areas to influence.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.173
 When I lived in Toronto, there were a variety of locations for Sexual Minorities

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:53.577
 offices for sexual minorities. I remember one who focused

00:01:53.577 --> 00:02:00.263
 lesbian rights, and many different politically oriented ones.

00:02:00.263 --> 00:02:04.111
 And when the debates happened, the media went to interview

00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:05.514
 these foundations.

00:02:05.514 --> 00:02:09.986
 They were non-profit political associations.

00:02:09.986 --> 00:02:17.260
 For example, if a police commissioner said something homophobic,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.546
 the media went for an interview.

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:22.266
 “Asking for its sexual minority organization, its support group

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:27.800
 opinion on this matter. "This is the right community.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.774
 It was one side and a part of Toronto’s fixed sexual minority

00:02:32.774 --> 00:02:36.995
 community, they had neighborhoods, buildings, offices,

00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:41.101
 they had lawyers, nightclubs, festivals (I mean now Toronto

00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:44.044
 sexual minority, not all were the same.)

00:02:44.044 --> 00:02:48.849
 There were many well-organized gay communities, and media

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.164
 could reach them.

00:02:51.164 --> 00:02:54.916
 It would be different if we were at the level of MADD. It would be different if we were

00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:58.256
 at the same level as the Jews of British Columbia.

00:02:58.335 --> 00:03:01.680
 Jews are a tiny minority in this part of Canada.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.616
 They have business premises, they have decent organizations,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.968
 they have grants and all sorts of benefits for people from cradle to grave.

00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:15.526
 And most of all, you can go there and take part in a picnic and talk to others

00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:19.875
 people face to face. Everything from fundraising to charity can

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:25.153
 make a big impression. I want it all, I want a decent community

00:03:26.511 --> 00:03:30.277
 and I see no reason to suggest that I did not want it or that I would not appreciate it.

00:03:30.404 --> 00:03:34.531
 I see no reason to suggest that veganism is entirely satisfactory to me,

00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:39.212
 if it’s just a diet or something I maintain in privacy, without

00:03:39.212 --> 00:03:40.561
 political sanctions.

00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:45.000
 I am a Jew about my heritage, I nihilistic atheist beliefs.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Nevertheless, my family and my life would benefit me more

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.999
 pretends to be a believing Jew, begins to participate in the synagogue,

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:04.933
 because Judaism in Canada can provide me with the right community.

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:08.533
 Everything from picnics to nursing homes.

00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:14.715
 From picnics to private schools and nursing homes, from cradle to grave.

00:04:14.715 --> 00:04:20.653
 The benefits of lifelong benefits are Judaism,

00:04:20.653 --> 00:04:29.000
 Mormonism, all sorts of mindless ideologies based on

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.283
 your faith in a God that does not exist are based on your prayers, which never will be

00:04:34.283 --> 00:04:41.154
 come to hear unless you say your prayers on Youtube.

00:04:41.154 --> 00:04:44.466
 Then your Youtube followers can hear you.

00:04:46.154 --> 00:04:51.501
 I look at groups like Mormons and think “I want all this, I want to

00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:52.844
 what you people have ".

00:04:52.844 --> 00:04:57.247
 There is no problem for Mormons to organize

00:04:57.247 --> 00:04:58.893
 200 people picnic.

00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:02.685
 For me, even that is not enough. There is no problem for Mormons to organize

00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:06.219
 fundraising for orphans, setting up a charity,

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.808
 embark on a project and change the world.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:13.935
 I want it, I want the same for vegans. I care about the whole life cycle,

00:05:13.935 --> 00:05:18.557
 from cradle to grave. I have a 3 year old daughter, I don’t see her often.

00:05:18.557 --> 00:05:23.778
 He lives in Europe, I live in China. Nevertheless - where my daughter goes

00:05:23.778 --> 00:05:27.687
 where does my daughter go to school, where does she go to day care?

00:05:27.687 --> 00:05:30.770
 Where do I go to the nursing home or where

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.953
 my grandparents go?

00:05:31.953 --> 00:05:34.390
 From cradle to grave.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.362
 The problems of gay legal activism also change over time.

00:05:39.362 --> 00:05:42.862
 In the recent past, gay communities have experienced severe setbacks,

00:05:42.862 --> 00:05:48.000
 and now gay communities can celebrate battles won. In Canada,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Saudi Arabia is another matter. In several

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.500
 gay rights are still the starting point,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.000
 don't get me wrong. But Canada is one of the first states to have

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 achieved equal marriage law, legal

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.386
 the fight has been fought for equal rights.

00:06:04.386 --> 00:06:08.104
 These battles have essentially already been won.

00:06:08.104 --> 00:06:12.102
 The battles for veganism are just beginning.

00:06:12.102 --> 00:06:15.917
 Where is that office? Where is that neighborhood, that nightclub?

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:19.763
 Where is that nursing home and kindergarten? I want it all.

00:06:19.763 --> 00:06:25.639
 I fundamentally more ambitious than Unnatural Vegan, I am not satisfied

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.044
 to what you call “community,” I’m not happy with a group of self-centered

00:06:30.044 --> 00:06:35.855
 middle-aged people who give each other thumbs on Facebook, I am not happy

00:06:35.855 --> 00:06:40.605
 For teens taking bikini pictures on Instagram who

00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:44.985
 claim to change the world. None of that works for me.

00:06:44.985 --> 00:06:52.100
 Alright? I want more. Can I have it today? En. Can I have it next year?

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:57.679
 En. Do I see it happen before I die? Perhaps.

00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:04.017
 MADD grew tremendously in a few years, which is the number of Americans really

00:07:04.017 --> 00:07:09.490
 care about MADD? It is a minority, a small minority

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.412
 people who support such an organization, amazingly successful.

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.922
 How many people are worth, to fund Jewish synagogues in Canada?

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:24.249
 I do not know, small, small minority. I have spoken Sikh

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:27.903
 Within Canada, these are minority religious movements

00:07:27.903 --> 00:07:34.623
 and again with gays, homosexuality is not a diet, they don’t have to

00:07:34.623 --> 00:07:39.781
 separate restaurants, but they have! Toronto has a neighborhood

00:07:39.781 --> 00:07:43.818
 is a gay restaurant, although there is no gay food!

00:07:43.818 --> 00:07:50.000
 Vegans, we already have a reason to organize business premises for restaurants.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.502
 I want it all, from cradle to grave.

00:07:55.502 --> 00:08:00.825
 From premises to lawyers and political organizations,

00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:05.294
 sufficiently prestigious foundations to allow for disputes in the state leadership

00:08:05.294 --> 00:08:09.076
 the media knows who to call. Maybe there are several foundations,

00:08:09.076 --> 00:08:14.265
 who call veganism in parliament,

00:08:14.265 --> 00:08:20.172
 in the media, on the street. I want it and I realize that

00:08:20.172 --> 00:08:23.353
 we are missing it. It’s the right community, and we need to see

00:08:23.353 --> 00:08:27.663
 work hard to achieve it.
