like you know we just happened to find
 

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.110 align:start position:0%
like you know we just happened to find

i<00:42:01.119><c> think</c><00:42:01.280><c> it's</c><00:42:01.440><c> like</c><00:42:01.520><c> one</c><00:42:01.680><c> percent</c><00:42:02.000><c> with</c><00:42:02.160><c> some</c>

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's like one percent with some
 

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.990 align:start position:0%
i think it's like one percent with some
