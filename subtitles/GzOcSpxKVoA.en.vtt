00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.300
If I were doing this really "F.A.Q. style",
[i.e.,] "frequently-asked-questions",

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.780
one of the most frequently asked questions
I get is,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.440
"But do we really know what the Buddha originally
said?"

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.230
How can we actually know what the Buddha taught,
thought, what his philosophy was,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:36.240
before all these mysterious centuries came
and went.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.320
People ask me all kinds of questions about
Buddhism,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.570
and, at least half of the time, they ask me
questions that they think they already know

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.810
the answer to,
as if they're going to trap me in some kind

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.560
of cognitive-dissonance-conundrum,
and then they're shocked that, no, I just

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.400
know the answer to the question,
and it's just a fact, and they could have

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.760
known it, and they never did.
So, here's a big one: do we know what the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.350
Buddha actually said? Do we have an historical
record of what the Buddha said, and taught

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.610
and thought,
or, is it some mystery, lost in the passage

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.610
of centuries?
Guess what? The answer is, yes, we do know.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.740
And we know the same way we know what Plato
thought, and how Aristotle thought, and how

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.950
all kinds of philosophers from the Han dynasty
in ancient China thought. And we know it because

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.640
somebody wrote it down.
It's not surprising at all that Buddhism survived,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.890
as a written philosophy.
Buddhism is one of the most influential philosophies

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.630
in the world,
and it happens to be a philosophy that was

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.260
paired with a religion that convinced millions
of people

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.759
(not thousands, but millions)
that the most important thing they could do

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.950
with their money was donate it to Buddhist
monks so they could copy out the texts by

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.420
hand to preserve them and recite them orally
in public performances.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.200
When you've got that kind of weight, that
kind of patronage backing you...

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.900
Let me just translate, "Patronage" means money.
When you've got that kind of money supporting

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.350
your philosophy, then it's not really surprising
at all that it survives the centuries.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.380
Let's look at a comparison that failed: the
philosophy of Lucretius.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.319
Maybe 80% of you don't know who Lucretius
was, or the name is just slightly familiar

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.670
from something you heard on National Public
Radio, or some kind of pretentious source

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.010
like that.
Lucretius was one of the most influential

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.700
philosophers in the history of the world.
Did his philosophy survive? Yes.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.569
How? It was written down on paper.
Is anyone surprised, is anyone impressed,

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.790
that this ancient philosophy managed to make
it through the centuries?

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.030
Well, only for one reason, and that is that
a different religion, a different philosophy

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.600
tried to persecute the followers of Lucretius,
tried to destroy the texts written down about

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.020
Lucretius (and his own texts), so that none
were left.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.250
What was the religion that persecuted the
philosophy of Lucretius? Christianity.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.840
So, history is funny that way.
Yeah, sometimes we're surprised, we're impressed

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.970
that something ancient survived into the modern
era, because, in the centuries in-between,

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.270
some group of people who had money, and violence,
and armies behind them, tried to destroy it.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.840
That was the case with Lucretius, but still
Lucretius is still here, you can get him out

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.780
of the library, in almost any language. It
has been translated into English a lot better

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.780
than the philosophy of the Buddha has been
translated.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.400
There's a sad comparison: how many translators
have worked on Lucretius, as opposed to how

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.140
many translators have studied the Pali canon,
just in the last few hundred years.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.140
Well, um... Did Buddhism encounter any similar
obstacle in its history in the last few centuries?

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.730
Yes. Yes, actually.
There was another religion and another philosophy

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.120
that tried to exterminate the followers of
Buddhism and destroy all of the texts, and

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.709
all of the statues, and every remnant of Buddhism,
and it was pretty successful in a little country

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.720
you might have heard of called India, and
another area to the north of India that's

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.159
today known as Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Do you know where I'm going with this?

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:18.970
Yes, that's right, Islam, as a religion, was
very, very successful in destroying Buddhism,

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.330
in destroying any trace of its teachings.
You can look further east to a country like

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.139
Indonesia. There are still a lot of tourists
who go to visit the ruins of Buddhist civilization

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.530
in Indonesia, places like Borobudur, but,
(guess what?) today, the vast majority of

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.990
people in Indonesia are Mulsim, and the Buddhists
who are there immigrated more recently from

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.370
China.
The indigenous tradition of the religion has

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.050
disappeared.
Ah, but maybe I'm not addressing the real

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.919
question looming here.
Why do people find it so surprising when I

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.030
give this simple, direct answer, that, yeah,
the philosophy of the Buddha is written down.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.300
Yeah, you can know what it is, if you just
do the same kind of work I did, you can read

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.120
it.
There's no excuse for being balefully ignorant

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.090
of one of the most influential philosophies
in the history of the world.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.360
Well, it's because Buddhists themselves like
to tell a lot of lies about this.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.689
I can't blame Muslims for telling these lies:
Mulsims are straightforward about what their

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.729
religion is, and what Buddhism is, and why
one group of people hates the other.

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:26.259
But Buddhists themselves have this long list
of excuses for why everybody's got time...&nbsp;[roaring

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.539
sound above]
(Air-force jets passing overhead.)

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:38.479
...everybody's got time to worship a statue,
everybody's got time for a long list of rituals

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.479
and ceremonies, but nobody gets around to
studying the philosophy of the Buddha.

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.469
I remember I had a funny experience with a
Zen Buddhist monk (in the Korean tradition

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:52.819
of Zen) who was actively trying to convert
me to Korean Zen,

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:57.419
and I kept pointing out to him, "Yeah, but,
you guys don't study the philosophy, you don't

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.389
have any contact with the philosophy of Buddhism,"
"You just perform these rituals, day after

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.839
day, and you chant the same one sutta again
and again."

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:11.580
(A sutta that barely managed to get over the
fence from badly-garbled Sanskrit into garbled

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:18.050
Chinese, and then from Chinese into Korean.)
And, you know, from a Zen perspective, from

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.789
the perspective of a lot of modern, authoritarian
traditions,

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:27.690
anyone who reads the texts is a threat to
the authority of the monk in charge.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:34.650
It's a lot more convenient to organize your
religion around silence, subservience to authority,

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.330
nobody asking questions, nobody debating the
philosophy.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.930
And if anyone says, "Wait a minute, what about
this guy called, 'The Buddha'?"

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.719
"His name is the same as the name of the religion."
"Shouldn't we be reading what he actually

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:51.479
wrote or said or something?"
Oh, [there is] a list of excuses ready to

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:57.770
go, one of which is, "Oh, oh, well, there
are more than 40,000 sutras recording the

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.639
Buddha's teaching, we could never study them
all."

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:06.139
Yeah, that's a great excuse, like, you can't
read all 40,000, so why even bother trying

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:12.759
to read, say, 500 or 1,000, right?
Other [excuses] are, "Oh, no, no, the real

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:18.789
teaching of the Buddha is lost in the mists
of time, so, you know, there's really no point."

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:24.830
"Therefore, just perform this ritual, just
do this meditation practice, just drink this

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.220
magic tea...".
Buddhists [have] a lot of interest in drinking

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.219
fancy tea for some reason, not so much [interest
in] reading the philosophy.

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:34.630
And, you know, this will be the substitute
[offered as an excuse].

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.779
[As if] somehow you're going to magically
re-capture the essence of the original Buddha's

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:45.889
teaching, not through study and hard work,
but through rituals and drinking tea,

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:49.919
and asking for donations, and then spending
the money from those donations,

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:54.729
that's been going on for a few centuries now,
and, mysteriously, nobody gets back to the

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:59.229
original philosophy of the Buddha, so, I think,
maybe we could all afford to change tactics

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:03.569
at this point.
However, another big comparison is to something

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:09.439
like Jesus: his original teachings were not
very well recorded, and yet Christians are

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:13.309
obsessed with reading the Bible, and with
getting familiar with the earliest writings

00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:18.819
available about Jesus. That doesn't seem to
be a big hang-up for them, so... there's more

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:23.959
than one comparison possible.
But Buddhism came out of a cultural background

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:28.949
very different from Judaism,
very different from Jesus-ism, whatever you

00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:33.629
call that these days,
and, y'know, that was different partly because

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:40.270
ancient India (before Buddhism emerged) was
already a culture obsessed with the idea that

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:47.620
a man should memorize and recite sacred text
every day.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:53.699
A man who was a lawyer, or the equivalent
of a mayor, a chieftan, he wouldn't rely on

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:58.120
written law,
no, no, no, the law of the county or the kingdom,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.750
that would be something set out in simple
verses to be memorized and recited,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:07.269
and one of the reasons for that is that when
you have a text memorized, you can call it

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:10.199
to mind immediately.
You can seem very authoritative, you can seem

00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:13.880
like you're in charge.
In Europe, we don't have a tradition like

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.420
this. We don't expect the chieftan or the
king to have the laws memorized, and ready-to-mind

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.350
at a moment's notice.
But it's humanly possible, I mean, the number

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.210
of people who have memorized the entire text
of Hamlet is amazing,

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.329
because Hamlet is really long and hard to
memorize,

00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:33.770
and many of the actors who are chosen to memorize
Hamlet aren't particularly intelligent,

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:38.829
they're just really good-looking, or charismatic,
or, y'know, they're chosen for the role for

00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:42.899
some other reason.
So, ordinary people can memorize a lot of

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:46.330
text. Human history has shown that again and
again.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:53.000
But ancient India was obsessed with this notion...
well, let's not fault them. This was a central,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.980
cultural value, already under Hinduism with
reciting the Vedas, with reciting law, with

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.000
reciting sacred texts in the ancient Hindu
tradition.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.589
And Buddhism emerged in that context,
so did ancient Jainism. Jainism, again, volumes

00:10:09.589 --> 00:10:16.290
and volumes of text were produced by Jainism,
recited, memorized, performed. Right?

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:22.620
Then we transition into a period of history
when that's backed up with meticulous, hand-made

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.579
books, copying these texts out, again and
again.

00:10:25.579 --> 00:10:29.829
Hey, how did Lucretius survive?
Lucretius was a philosopher, he didn't have

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:35.040
millions of people devoting their lives to
copying out his writing by hand and memorizing

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.940
it, and performing it in public.
He didn't have millions of people who believed

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:45.009
that this was a profoundly meaningful, magical,
transcendental act, to try to keep his words

00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:50.029
alive, in exactly the form he wrote them,
but Buddhism did. Buddhism had the weight

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:53.259
of this cultural obsession behind it, from
day 1.

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:57.050
And so did Jainism. Jainism, again, the text
still exists.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.189
It's not that surprising. Maybe it's much
more surprising that we have any texts left

00:11:01.189 --> 00:11:06.819
from a culture like ancient Egypt, but, we
do. We have texts from ancient China. The

00:11:06.819 --> 00:11:10.910
ancient Han Chinese didn't have this culture
of preserving text.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:17.459
So, Buddhist texts survived, despite being
conquered by Islam, because Buddhism spread

00:11:17.459 --> 00:11:20.800
outside of the area that was conquered by
Islam.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:28.699
Buddhism disappeared in India, Buddhism disappeared
in Indonesia, if the Muslims had conquered

00:11:28.699 --> 00:11:33.901
all of Asia right up to Japan, then, yeah,
Buddhism would have disappeared from this

00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:36.430
world, and we wouldn't know what the Buddha
taught.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:42.470
But in places like Sri Lanka, in Myanmar,
yup, you can read what the Buddha really said...

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.763
I'll come back to how that is, [but] to me,
it shouldn't be surprising, it shouldn't be

00:11:46.763 --> 00:11:51.769
shocking to anyone,
and, yeah, in fragments, it survived in Tibet

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:55.579
(Tibet was never conquered by Muslims), it
survived in China in a very garbled form,

00:11:55.579 --> 00:12:01.560
in the Chinese Agamas, you can [barely] piece
it together [from Chinese sources], yeah,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.040
China, also, [was] not conquered by Muslim
armies,

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.279
although they've had their own tumultuous
history.

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:12.230
That's the long and the short of it.
Of course the texts exist.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:18.810
Any monk who tells you the texts don't exist
is offering you the most pathetic excuse for

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.810
his own ignorance,
and it is his job to be a custodian of these

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.060
texts,
it is his job to represent this philosophy,

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.709
to give voice to this philosophy,
and to practice the philosophy.

00:12:29.709 --> 00:12:34.410
It's nobody else's job. It's not my job!
If you're a Buddhist monk, you should step

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.379
up, and rep your set; you should do the bare
minimum here.

00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:46.940
Okay, then, the other area of slightly phony
skepticism is, "Well, you got this thing called

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:52.230
the Pali Canon."
"There are a lot of pages, and it's very heavy."

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:57.819
"It looks like hard work to study."
Y'know, "How much of this is the recorded

00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:01.420
word of the Buddha?"
Well, look, man, go to the library, and look

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:06.370
at the works of Plato. Y'know, it's also really
big, it's really heavy.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.910
Yeah, if you want to dig into the footnotes
with Plato, how do we really know what Plato

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.579
wrote?
Y'know, there's more than one version, there

00:13:13.579 --> 00:13:16.509
are comparisons, there are minor differences
in wording,

00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:20.339
it's heavy, it's daunting.
Guess what? So is Shakespeare.

00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:24.760
How do we know what the real text is of Shakespeare's
Hamlet? It was a lot of work for somebody,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.319
sure.
You can go through, you can compare different

00:13:27.319 --> 00:13:32.470
extant manuscripts, you can look at minor
differences in wording, different versions,

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:39.060
yeah, that exists.
But, for 99.9% of people, those issues are

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:44.829
irrelevant.
99.9% of people see Hamlet, read Plato, hear

00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:49.649
about Lucretius on the radio, and they're
not digging into the text in that kind of

00:13:49.649 --> 00:13:52.870
detail.
I have! I've written some essays, you can

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.690
read Canon and Reason, it deals with some
of these more detailed issues of "How did

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:01.309
the text survive?" What are the issues with
comparative reading of different sources,

00:14:01.309 --> 00:14:08.339
and how do we know what we know.
Man... are five people going to read that

00:14:08.339 --> 00:14:11.120
essay? Maybe 15 people are going to read that
essay?

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.759
Very few people have the kind of detailed
interest to dig into that issue.

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:20.350
And I'm not complaining! It's natural! It's
the same with Shakespeare or Plato: almost

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:25.009
nobody wants to know.
So, don't pretend that those issues, those

00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:32.860
kinds of footnoted, scholarly issues, in establishing
the details of the text, are a valid excuse

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.920
for not knowing the philosophy at all.
They're not a valid excuse for the average

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.880
person,
and they're definitely not an excuse for a

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.880
Buddhist monk,
who has a kind of professional obligation

00:14:42.880 --> 00:15:01.180
to know about this guy called the Buddha whose
name is in the name of the religion.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.180
[Noise of an airplane overheaed.]
We're still fighting World War Two here. It

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.639
hasn't ended yet.
So, you look at a text, for example, like

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:10.160
the Bhaddekaratta Sutta.
You have multiple versions of the text that

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.019
are grouped together in the Pali canon,
and already in the ancient period, there was

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:18.959
an interest in preserving more than one interpretation
of the text.

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:23.459
There's a poem at its core, which is the same
in the different versions, and then we get

00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:28.889
different Buddhist monks, and the Buddha himself,
offering, uh, an interpretation or an explanation

00:15:28.889 --> 00:15:34.540
of the poem.
Also built into that example is the idea that

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.980
it's the obligation of the monk to memorize
and recite this kind of religious poetry.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:48.180
So, yeah, at its core, Buddhism was a religion
obsessed with memorizing and reciting the

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:54.279
philosophical poetry written down by the master,
by the founder of the religion, the guy we

00:15:54.279 --> 00:16:01.079
call the Buddha,
and, y'know, any concerns you might have,

00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:09.940
that the poem as it exists today is not precisely
what existed 2,500 years ago,

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.600
it's a valid concern,
and I'd encourage you, if you've got the brains,

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.660
you can apply that concern to Plato, you can
apply it to any other ancient text,

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:26.649
but, when you dig into those details, it's
not going to give you the answers to the questions

00:16:26.649 --> 00:16:31.319
you want to know.
The questions that most people are interested

00:16:31.319 --> 00:16:38.079
in --philosophically-- are not philological
details.

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:45.699
And the fact that those philological details
exist isn't an excuse for your own ignorance.

00:16:45.699 --> 00:16:53.970
I can do another Youtube video dealing with
philological details, but, I mean, like, maybe

00:16:53.970 --> 00:17:01.170
5 people are going to watch it, right?
