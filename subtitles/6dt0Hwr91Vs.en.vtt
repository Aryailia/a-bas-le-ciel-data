00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.450
This is what I walk through, every day, every
couple of days.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:15.389
So, really, this is what you'd expect to see
on your walk to work, on your walk to school,

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.820
pretty much anywhere in Canada.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.460
I'm out here on the West Coast, Vancouver
Island, but, y'know, in the past, I used to

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.500
live in downtown Toronto.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.820
It's pretty much the same as this.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.410
You throw a dart at the map, anywhere in Canada,
this is what you'd expect to see.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.940
I don't want to mislead you if you're watching
this in China or Japan.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.270
Y'know, one part of Canada is pretty much
the same as the other.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.440
You see this?

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.440
You see this?

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.940
Nowhere is safe, man.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:12.710
Nowhere is safe.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.350
So on this walk, already, I have seen deer,
and some wild rabbits.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.680
Today I did not see any woodpeckers but the
signs of them are everywhere around us.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.420
Like I say, it's pretty much the same as living
in Toronto or anywhere else, being here on

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.420
the West Coast of B.C.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.590
It's just, y'know, your absolutely typical
walk to school, walk to work, for any Canadian.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.049
Not as many bears out here on the island.

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.060
Not so much of a concern about bear attacks.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.259
I mean, I guess the differences are little
things, like, uh, differences of dialect.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.210
They have these bushes here that grow berries,
I don't know if we'll come up on one, they're

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.940
just about everywhere, and, uh, local people
call them blackberries.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.689
I find that a little bit weird, y'know.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.260
We have the same thing in the streets of Toronto,
y'know, just about everywhere.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.890
We used to call them crack berries.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.090
I don't know what that is, it's like a difference
in dialect or something.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.510
It's like the only thing you can get in the
streets of Toronto after about 8:00 PM.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.390
Something like that.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.670
So, on a regular day this is really quite
a busy area.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.180
This is their First Nations House, that they
choose to call First People's House, for reasons

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.340
that would take a while to explain.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.140
This is not a regular, functional building
on the campus.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.319
It is partly, of course, a symbolic gesture
to our Native People, here in British Columbia,

00:02:51.319 --> 00:03:00.349
in recognition, with some sense of gratitude,
that, uh, this university is being built on

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.910
their bones and their ashes, and on the snuffed-out
potential of what their civilization could

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.620
have been, if it weren't ground under the
boot-heel of the British Empire.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.230
And while that recognition here may merely
be symbolic, I do appreciate it, and I do

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.290
appreciate going to a university that has
this type of symbolic architecture at its

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.959
center (literally and figuratively), rather
than being a university that has a Christian

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:35.269
church, or a Catholic cathedral, or even a
Buddhist temple.

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:41.720
So, while that may be merely symbolic, uh,
I do appreciate it.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.470
Now, I would appreciate it quite a bit more
if any First Nations language were taught

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.250
on this campus, any one whatsoever, and if
it were possible for a single student to learn

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.769
a single sentence in any Native Language,
at a time when those languages are struggling

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.790
to survive.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.790
There it is.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.360
I chose an evening when this usually-bustling
area is completely empty.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.070
And that's pretty much the core of the campus.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.949
It'll be closed now, but at the end of that
garden path is the dining hall, where there

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.220
are indeed vegan options.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.240
So this looks like we're back in the middle
of the forest, but this is the dead center

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.110
of the campus.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.330
This is where I pay to read books and, uh,
to have professors pretend that they respect

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.499
my opinion.

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:44.190
They do a very nice job on the landscaping
(for a Canadian university).

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.509
It's not really impressive compared to universities
in Taiwan, to be honest with you.

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:56.259
But, of course, part of what's going on here
is that the university has to justify the

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.210
cost of tuition, and they have competition
right next door.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.430
Just a couple of bus-stops away, there's another
university called Camosun where they teach

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.789
some of the same things at a much lower price.

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.809
And, actually, when I was studying Chinese,
people were telling me that the next university

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:19.659
down the street had a better quality Chinese
education at a lower price, and when I was

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.370
studying Japanese, actually, the professor
herself suggested that I try that university

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.650
(the competition, just a few bus-stops away),
again suggesting that I would get a better

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.009
education at a lower price there.

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.089
But, part of what you pay for is the view,
I guess.
