00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.430
When people talk about the simplification
of the Chinese language they're normally referring

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.389
to just the most recent developments of the
20th century.

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.270
However, you'll also find that textbooks talk
about simplification with another sense of

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.850
the term in mind, stretching back for more
than a thousand years --basically, throughout

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.870
the whole known history of the written language.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.340
My first example is this word yàn.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.300
This is a reasonably ancient word that appears
in literary figures of speech, but rarely

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.480
in everyday conversation.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.050
The basic meaning of the word is "swallow"
--not the verb, "to swallow", but the noun,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.420
meaning a type of migrating bird.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.850
If this is your first time seeing the character,
you might wonder how this set of radicals

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.190
ever gained a meaning related to birds, especially
given how many other words there are in Chinese

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.100
that clearly enough show pictographs of a
bird, facing left, like niǎo [鳥].

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.390
The more you know about these radicals, the
stranger it seems.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.989
On the left and right we have the two halves
of běi, meaning "north", that we could also

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.550
think of as a doubled spoon radical (although,
as I mentioned in an earlier video, the spoon

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.860
radical is often used to represent a human
figure in Chinese).

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.540
At the bottom of the character we have the
standard abbreviation of the fire radical

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.550
as four dots.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.140
In the middle of the glyph we have the mouth
radical, or, at least, a box of some kind,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.560
leaving us with a bit of a mystery at the
top, as that figure isn't really a radical

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.810
at all.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.580
The closest character in modern script is
niàn, a literary way to write the numeral

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.190
20.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:47.790
So, when we put the whole character together,
it looks like complete nonsense; and it is.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.810
How did we end up with a type of bird being
represented by assembling together the symbols

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.630
meaning "twenty", "mouth", "north" and "fire"?

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.900
If the language has so many other symbols
that just directly show you a picture of a

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.060
bird, why was it necessary for the language
to resort to this complex combination to indirectly

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.640
suggest its meaning?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.680
When we look back at clerical script, the
symbols have become a bit more symmetrical,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.860
but there's no clear hint as to how it all
ended up this way.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.860
Seal script gives us a very clear next step,
and then, suddenly, we can see what the symbols

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.110
were supposed to represent in the oracle bones.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.710
In the extremely remote past this was a picture
of a bird, with the head at the top, two wings

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.790
on either side, and so on.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.000
If you try writing out the character using
the full form of the fire radical, you can

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.700
see that the seal script was trying to render
the feathered tail of the bird with four lines

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.210
that vaguely resembled the fire radical --but
even this vague resemblance disappears when

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.250
the radical is reduced to just four dots.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.590
Although the four dots are a standard way
to reduce the fire radical to a half-size

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.370
form, it can obscure the etymology of the
word; in this example we'd be able to "see"

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.569
the character much better without the abbreviation.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.920
Is this what we mean by the "simplification"
of Chinese characters?

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.150
Well, historically it is one of the most important
types of changes that we observe: a unified

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.010
pictograph is broken down into smaller pieces,
and those pieces are made to resemble radicals.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.100
Unfortunately, if we're really being honest,
the result of this historical process is complete

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.569
nonsense; and this is one of the reasons why
so many native speakers of Chinese don't really

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.830
want to learn the radicals, feeling that they'll
only get more confused by knowing this stuff.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.319
Just to provide a rapid contrast to a very
different pictograph of a bird, I can remember

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.670
that the first time I saw this character it
just looked like a grid of lines to me.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.690
I managed to convince myself that it has some
resemblance to the ancient picture of a bird

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.010
(facing left).

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.251
In this case we're also looking at a process
of "simplification", but here the image has

00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:09.680
been retained as a single unit, instead of
being broken into separate radicals.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:17.400
However, the streamlining of the brushstrokes
has, again, reduced sense into nonsense.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.400
My third example seems simple, as the bottom
half is an easily-recognized symbol, clearly

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.570
related to the meaning of the word.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.020
However, what is the top half, exactly?

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.790
This isn't a radical, it isn't a phonetic
component, it isn't a character and it can't

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.280
be broken down into radicals, either.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.031
The vast majority of Chinese students will
memorize the shape without knowing what it

00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:46.560
is supposed to be, but, in fact, we're looking
at an indirect echo of the same image of "two

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.570
hands doing something" that we can still see
at the top of the character meaning "to study"

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.639
(here shown in the bottom-right corner).

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.620
The seal-script showing the two hands at the
top doesn't provide any kind of shocking revelation

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.600
about the meaning of the word, however it
is a meaningful symbol, and it should provide

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.120
the student with a reminder of the meaning
of the word, and, also, a bridge to related

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.070
words (that use the same image of two hands
completing a task).

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.850
Instead, what was once a meaningful symbol
has been simplified into something that is

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.139
completely meaningless.

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.100
Again, this isn't "simplification" in the
modern sense; this didn't happen in the 20th

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.100
century.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.590
What we're talking about here is a much longer,
historical process of scribal changes that

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.250
erases the logic that was once present in
the composition of the characters.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.510
So the ancient simplification of characters
presents a few different problems for modern

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.680
students.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.810
As we saw in the first example, unique images
that actually show the meaning of the word

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.250
(and might be easy to remember) have been
broken down into a series of smaller symbols

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.150
that don't make any sense at all.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.690
In these cases, there's no analysis of the
symbols that will tell you the sound or meaning

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.870
of the word: the radicals genuinely don't
make sense, they've become an indirect way

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.980
of sketching the original image (only known
from the oracle bones).

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.520
With all of the types of simplification we've
looked at, the meaningful links between characters

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.520
disappear.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.280
We lose associations of meaning, sound and
etymology that formerly made the language

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.100
more rewarding to learn, and, at the same
time, there are false resemblances and false

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:37.350
links between characters being created.
