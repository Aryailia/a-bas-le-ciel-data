00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.719
Buddhist meditation.
People always want to make exceptions to the

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:32.529
rule when the subject comes to Buddhist meditation.
People always want to make statements without

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.260
having done any reading,
without providing any footnotes or any sources,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.440
Buddhist meditation is certainly a subject
that everyone feels that they're an expert

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.760
on, even more than, say, Yoga.
At least people go to some kind of school

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.320
or quote some book, when they make a claim
about Hindu Yoga.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.839
Plenty of that is bullshit too, don't get
me wrong,

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.930
but wow, modern, western people will make
up anything about Buddhist meditation,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.439
and, of course, East Asia has been racing
to catch up in the Bullshit Olympics.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.680
And Why? Because there's money involved!
I've heard many atheists say on Youtube that

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.390
the ultimate scam in the world is to convince
people that they have to pay you money so

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.280
that you can run a church, on behalf of an
invisible god.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.720
No, I beg to differ. Running a church and
doing all the things a church does, that's

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.000
a lot of work, that costs a lot of money.
If you can get people to line up and pay you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
money so they can sit in silence, that's the
ultimate scam. Oh, wait, to compete with it,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.270
what if people pay you just to learn how to
breathe?

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.710
Yes, "breathing meditation". [In] Buddhism
we have some of the most lucrative scams in

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.710
the game, as far as religion goes.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.090
When atheists, uh, get animated about creationism... Creationism, for those of you who don't know, is an example I'm drawing from modern,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.840
Protestant Christianity (maybe some Catholics are interested [in it], too).

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.760
Creationism is the idea that we can scientifically
prove that god created the world, and that

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.910
the biblical account of, the biblical description
of the origin of the world, is totally incompatible

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.489
with the theory of evolution, and with geology
and other findings of modern science.

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.489
Creationism: what makes it so embarrassing?
So difficult to listen to?

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.340
What makes you wince and feel uncomfortable,
when people are giving apologies for, explanations

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.730
of, creationism?
It's not that they're wrong about particular

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.069
facts. Being wrong is something that happens
to human beings,

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.160
and, y'know, we're all infinitely ignorant.
It's easy to sympathize with someone who's

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.150
just factually wrong, and it isn't even that
they're wrong ethically or morally...

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.080
...although, obviously, there's a lot wrong
[ethically] with their position [too]...

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.080
What makes it hard to even listen to a creationist
argument is that they're trying so hard to

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.510
use the bible to answer questions that are
neither asked nor answered in the bible.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.610
I remember a video that was posted by James
Randi (a magician, who later became a kind

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.889
of cheerleader for skepticism and atheism),
and he was asked a question from the audience

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:32.509
by a woman who was quite offended by his atheism.
This woman demanded of him, from her position

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.889
as a Christian creationist, "Well, how do
you explain gravity? How do you explain time?"

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:46.889
And, actually, James Randi, he got flustered,
he didn't give a very good reply.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.699
But, what makes it so absurd for the creationist
to attack modern science isn't that their

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.110
particular answers are wrong. This woman,
for example, in attacking James Randi, she

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:06.110
thought of the bible as a book that did have
an answer to the question, "What is gravity?"

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.719
[and] "What is time?" Those questions are
neither asked nor answered in the Bible!

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.580
If you think modern science doesn't answer
them sufficiently, well, at least you can

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.129
go to a bookshelf and get out a book (or any
number of books) that are titled, "What is

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:29.430
gravity?", "What is time?", [written] from
various perspectives and disciplines, asking

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.219
these questions philosophically, in terms
of theoretical phyiscs, all kinds of material

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:37.849
on that.
And it's totally lacking in the bible! The

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.629
bible doesn't give you an answer one way or
the other, y'know, [e.g.] the famous trial

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:49.629
of Galileo Galilei, well, y'know, the bible
doesn't really contain a doctrine about the

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:54.309
earth rotating around the sun or the sun rotating
[around the earth]. It's not important, from

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:59.399
the perspective of the bible, although a few
little quotations were brought together [in

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:02.469
the trial] and the fear of Heliocentrism [was
a factor], obviously, there's a long story

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:07.899
there, some of you will now, some of you don't.
But it's painful to see Christians getting

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:14.539
upset over something that they should really
be indifferent to.

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:21.539
There shouldn't be a conflict over the geological
age of the earth. Obviously, [that's] my opinion,

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:28.649
but the whole enterprise of creationism is
based on this ludacris need for the bible

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:37.249
to answer questions it doesn't even ask.
This is a video about Buddhist meditation.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:44.270
Let me tell you, when modern, western people
look for "meditation" in the ancient sutras,

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.179
they're asking questions that aren't even
there.

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:57.479
Their idea of what the word meditation is,
what it means, has nothing to do with anything

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.129
dealt with in the canon.
I've seen so many claims that Buddhist meditation

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:07.719
is, "a science of the mind", that it is equivalent
to modern C.B.T., cognitive behavioral therapy,

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:12.889
another great way to make money, let me tell
you, [there's] no scientific basis to it,

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:19.309
but hey. Y'know, the idea that Buddhism is
psychotherapy, that Buddhist meditation has

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:26.309
some kind of medical function for the mind,
comparable to the wildest fantasies of eary

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:36.669
Freudians, when they were devising psychotherapy
--fantasies they later gave up on, of course,

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:41.909
because their pseudoscience never got the
results [they] hoped for.

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:48.539
Um, y'know, you're asking questions that are
totally irrelevant to the interests of the

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:53.490
ancient texts and the ancient religion.
This video, I'm going to keep it short, I

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.719
could do a long series, but that would probably
be depressing for everyone involved.

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:04.559
What happens when you really do meditate,
when you achieve jhána, the sequence of jhánas,

00:08:04.559 --> 00:08:10.110
set out in the Pali canon?
Do you get in touch with your inner child?

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:15.599
Or feel better about your bourgeois life,
or some shit like this? Do you get the outcomes

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:20.800
of modern psychotherapy? Of the modern science
of the mind? The desiderata of cognitive behavioral

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.039
therapy? No.
It is an experience that makes it impossible

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:30.909
for you to live in society. You must renounce
all your worldly possessions, you must give

00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:37.140
up sex for the rest of your life, and your
transformation isn't merely mental, it's also

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.539
supernatural.
You gain the ability to walk through walls,

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:45.610
and fly through the air like Superman.
And, just in case some of you are tempted

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:51.110
to believe that this, also, is science, like,
"Well, hey, c'mon, maybe some people in ancient

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:56.490
India really had the ability to fly through
the air like Superman", the original, ancient

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:02.009
descriptions of what that's like themselves
make it impossible to believe that anyone

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:04.540
ever did this.
We all know that if these people could fly

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.529
through the air like Superman, the first thing
they'd be complaining about is getting the

00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:12.100
wind in their eyes, and how hard it is to
see anything, and a number of other practical

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.899
factors, [such as] freezing in the upper atmostphere,
but no, we get poetic descriptions of the

00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:24.899
joy of flying through the air, and feeling
the surface of the sun with your fingertips.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:33.730
This is an ancient, magical view of the world,
that presumed the sun [to be] much smaller

00:09:34.459 --> 00:09:40.060
than we know it is, in terms of modern science,
that the sun was much closer to the earth

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.009
than we know it is, according to modern science,
and that the sun isn't nearly as hot, as we

00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:48.920
know it is,
because that's the vision, it's a vision any

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.339
child could come up with in their dreams,
but it's obviously not a vision that reflects

00:09:54.339 --> 00:09:58.620
[the experience of] someone who actually achieved
this superpower through meditation.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:05.620
Let me tell you, no matter how hard you meditate,
you're neither going to get the phony, pseudo-medical

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:12.360
results, claimed by modern snake-oil salesmen,
cynically, in the name of Buddhism,

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.430
nor are you going to get the results promised
by the ancient texts, which are magical, which

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:23.040
are supernatural in their nature,
and which, frankly, deserve respect --deserve

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:29.180
to be studied-- like any ancient religion,
whether it's Socrates, Aristotle, or the Han

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:34.959
dynasty philosophers of ancient China,
but this should not be regarded as science.

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:40.160
In a sense, it's disrespectful both to us
as a modern audience, and [to] the ancient

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:46.120
texts to evaluate them in that way.
Appreciate what is ancient as ancient, and

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.459
let's appreciate what's modern and scientific
as modern.
