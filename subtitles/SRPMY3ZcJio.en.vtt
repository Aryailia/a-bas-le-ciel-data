00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.019
First of all I'm vegan so not vegan again

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.650
 I didn't become vegan because I wanted to be part of the community

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:23.150
 Within 5 seconds unnatural vegan makes me frankly realistic remarks here

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.609
 A community that touched on another theme that might be notorious for

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.339
 About in the past I have some on youtube

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:42.110
 What does the video say that vegans have a community?

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.710
 We talked about what it means so far we are a community

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.040
 Have you ever had or will you cooperate with each other in the community

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.929
 What's interesting about vegan in this video

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:10.530
 Belonging to the community is not a goal but a concern for her

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.579
 Not even I agree with her in this regard

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:21.170
 I don't criticize her I pay attention to you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.880
 What I want you to do is the disagreement between me and unnatural vegan I am ambitious

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.720
 I'm home and more greedy I want a real community

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.200
 Take madd as an example.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.820
 They have at least one office / branch in each state of the United States

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.189
 Eh, there are 50 states in the United States, so at least 50 offices in the United States

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.350
 There is a staff at every branch and there is always

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.210
 It ’s meant to be visited. It ’s something they have and we do n’t have.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.670
 Tell me now, as of 2016, drunk driving or biganism

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.640
 Is more important? I think the answer is clear.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.460
 It ’s a ganism. In the past, you see, the 1980s madd is very

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.610
 It may have been argued that it was an important pressure group, but as of now

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.239
 What is veganism? It absolutely requires more than 50 offices nationwide.

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.310
 Message I'm still a gay group

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.540
 It has risen sharply since it was neglected and is very influential

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.910
 I remember the time when I was still living in Toronto

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:45.989
 Homosexuality with a number of gay offices and regular staff

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.000
 I remember well after there was an office trying to protect the rights of others

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.349
 There are lesbian offices and others have different politics

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.290
 Something about homosexuality, even if there is an office that supports the idea

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.560
 When there was a dispute, a newspaper reporter interviewed the office

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.260
 Those offices that went were non-profit organizations

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.519
 It was also a political organization, for example, if the police secretary hates homosexuality

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:22.670
 Newspaper reporters give the opinions of gay and lesbian organizations and gay rights when they make bad statements

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.780
 Visit their office to cover the opinions of the claiming group

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.810
 And this is the real community

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.780
 A real gay community like this in Toronto back then

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.790
 There were districts and districts on which they were based

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.879
 Building office attorney nightclub festival and all other organizations

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.730
 But all cities have such a gay community

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.740
 Doesn't have a number of well-controlled in Toronto

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.370
 There were a number of gay communities with a voice and something

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.000
 Newspaper reporters visited them as they went

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.740
 If we are vegan in madd or British Columbia, Canada

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.709
 The story would be different if it were on a scale like the Jews of

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.770
 Jews are a tiny minority in that part of Canada

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:22.850
 Even such people have their own facilities, friendship scholarships with group friends, and education.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.510
 Various during life from birth to death with funds

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.850
 Have a community that can benefit from the community

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.420
 One member goes there and participates in picnics with other members

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.460
 You can meet, start fundraising, do charity, etc.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.960
 You can try activities to achieve something big change

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.440
 I want to make all of them a real vegan community

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.130
 I want to see that I don't want it or the community exists

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.330
 There is no reason to pretend to be meaningless

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.720
 Zum is just a diet, your own, and totally political

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.870
 Pretending to be satisfied by saying that it will not bring results

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.170
 There is no reason to do I was born as a Jew

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.410
 Is now a nihilistic atheist but for my family and for me

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:19.250
 It ’s better to go to a temple and worship and pretend to believe in Judaism.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.780
 It would be beneficial because there is a real Jewish community in Canada

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.720
 There is everything from picnics to elderly homes

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.130
 The Jewish community has a lifetime from picnics to private schools for the elderly

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.360
 Belonging to the community through has many advantages and

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.170
 It enshrines not only Judaism but also Mormonism and non-existent gods on youtube

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.180
 A prayer that no one will ask unless you say it in the video above

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.520
 Even those who believe in a number of crazy thoughts that only need to offer such

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.190
 You can get various benefits in the community

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.540
 Whenever I see an organization such as Mormon, I have a community they have

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.540
 I want all of 200 for Mormon people

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.490
 It ’s never been to preside over a picnic where people get together.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.040
 But that's not even enough for me to help orphans for them

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.190
 Donating money and starting useful activities in the world is a trick

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.750
 Not even vegan i want it

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.250
 I want people to have such a community I was born

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.090
 I care about my life from the cradle to the graveyard

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.460
 I have a 3 year old daughter my daughter lives in Europe and i live in China

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.040
 I can't meet much in any school or nursery school where my daughter is still

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.810
 What kind of old-age home do I go to? Where is my grandfather and grandmother?

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.150
 I'm always thinking about whether it will be taken care of by the cradle

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.110
 Homosexual rights issues over time to the graveyard

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.580
 It will change as you go, not long ago the gay community

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.170
 Have spent days of fierce struggle but now they

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.300
 Congratulates you on winning such a struggle

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.440
 Of course in Canada but in countries like Saudi Arabia

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.880
 It ’s a different story. It ’s still a battle for gay rights in this world.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.880
 There are many countries that have just started, but here in Canada is the world

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.463
 But it was one of the first countries where same-sex marriage was allowed and related to it

00:06:50.463 --> 00:06:52.170
 There was a court battle that went on and they effectively won the battle and got the right.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.310
 The battle for veganism is still in its infancy

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:04.740
 Where are vegan offices like where are many vegans

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.450
 There is an area where people live and there is a nightclub where vegans gather

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.740
 Where are the vegan homes and nurseries?

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.590
 I want them all I'm basically much better than unnatural vegan

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.500
 Ambitious I'm in the vegan community that many think

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.220
 Not satisfied at all For me, a self-deprecating middle-aged person is good on facebook

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.220
 I'm not satisfied with the community I'm sleeping with

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.818
 And teenagers wear swimsuits and smartphone their ass

00:07:25.818 --> 00:07:27.390
 Take it with and post it on Instagram and say we are changing the world

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.390
 I can't stand pretending to be a community

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.390
 I want more can it be achieved today

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.390
 No next year no maybe by the time I die

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.610
 Maybe it's happening madd has grown exponentially within a few years

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.636
 What percentage of Americans are interested in madd

00:07:33.636 --> 00:07:34.710
 It's a very small number. Minority It's true that the minority people support each other now.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.440
 Even though they have created a successful organization, what percentage of the population is Judaism in Canada

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.440
 Do you support Judaism by donating money to temples in Japan?

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.400
 I'm not sure, but it's a pretty minority

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.470
 In the past I talked about Sikhism in Canada but they are only a few

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.600
 I'm doing a religious movement in a sect, and when I return the theme to homosexuals

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.840
 Homosexuality has nothing to do with eating habits They principle a special restaurant

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.460
 I don't need it as a gay restaurant

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.430
 Homosexual restaurants in Toronto

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.690
 There are areas where there are no special gay foods

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.190
 We vegans specialize in vegans

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.790
 I need a restaurant It seems to say many times but I'm Bee

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.660
 I want a cancer community From birth to death

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.270
 Set up a temple-like meeting place to take care of you and hold a lawyer

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.610
 Every time there is a controversy or controversy in the government

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.430
 A community that has a political organization or a foundation or association that receives a call

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.050
 In the future, some people will speak for vegan claims in Congress and in the newspapers.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.030
 May I want them and that

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.350
 We recognize that such a community does not exist vegan

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:29.000
 Is working hard to realize such a real community

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.319
 I have to go
