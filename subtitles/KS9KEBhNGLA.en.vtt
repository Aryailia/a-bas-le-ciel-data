00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:07.210
As I mentioned in a few videos recently, I
am the sort of guy who reads annual financial

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.870
reports from major vegan foundations and institutions
because I'm trying to learn from their experience.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.970
I'm trying to learn from what they're doing
right and what they're doing wrong.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.910
And I was surprised when I found in the pages
of the Vegan Society’s Annual Report, they

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.730
claim that the word vegan is their trademark.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.300
Not only do they have the word trademarked,
they are successfully using this trademark

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.039
to generate quite a lot of money, you can
see the exact amount of money in British pounds

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:42.940
on screen, it works out to be more than half
a million U.S. dollars per year.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:52.670
That's a surprise, I think for anyone who
conceives of veganism as a political movement,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.070
as an ideology, or even as a diet, you're
shocked to find out that the word vegan is

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.760
held as a trademark.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.960
If it's going to be held as a trademark, I'm
happy to learn that the vegan society owns

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.290
it as a trademark and it's not owned by some
other for-profit company or entity or corporation,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.170
that'd be even stranger.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.189
But nevertheless, I can't say I'm really comfortable
with the idea of anyone having a trademark

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.869
on the word vegan, I don't think anyone can
be comfortable with seeing that there's a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.539
trademark on their own political ideology.

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.590
And I have over the years seen some products
avoid using the word vegan, they use these

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.079
other terms like plant-based, or they just
have a whole other sentence on the package

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.409
saying it “does not contain any animal products
or any animal derived products.”

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.390
It never occurred to me that some of those
products might be avoiding the use of the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.439
word ‘vegan,’ because it was trademarked
or because there'd be an expectation for them

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.780
to actually pay money to a foundation or agency,
to be able to use the word.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.509
Now I don't have any reason to think that
the vegan society is abusing their power in

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.569
holding this trademark, I'd be very interested
even to know if anyone wants to email me if

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.610
they've heard something or read something
about what the implications of this are for

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.650
companies who are using the word vegan.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.140
I just feel that we already have too much
of a problem, with individuals and political

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.790
movements avoiding the word vegan.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.900
It'd be a much longer video if I got into
that, but I've seen that, I've even seen formal

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.840
political movements within Canada that said
no, they didn't want to use the word vegan,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.660
that we're using these other complex terms
about animal rights and ecology and what-have-you.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.659
And I really do like the simplicity and directness
and honesty of the word vegan, I like its

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:53.950
simplicity in a reference to a diet and ethics
and ecology and as a political heading.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:02.090
I don't want to stop using the word vegan
because someone, somewhere, holds a trademark,

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.989
has the copyright, has the exclusive rights
to determine what isn't vegan.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.920
I felt as though this was a word that all
of us owned, and all of us participated in

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.750
and that all of us were working towards.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.170
You know starting out for ourselves with veganism
met in our own lives and yeah it comes as

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.260
a bit of a shock, it is fundamentally a little
bit weird to find out that no, it's a trademark,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.650
even if it's the vegan society themselves
they hold that trademark and that it's a trademark

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.170
that is being milked for half a million dollars
a year.
