00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.249
I got a reasonably profound question the last
time I was live-streaming and I thought I'd

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:07.919
make an effort to give it a reasonably profound
answer.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.480
There was a question from the audience about
the meaning of happiness in my life and already

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.599
there's a sort of peculiar puzzle in the fact
that we're using the word happiness and not

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.670
the word satisfaction.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.650
I think with happiness we almost have a double
meaning.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.110
Is happiness something fleeting; is happiness
something durable; is happiness something

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.290
shallow or is happiness something profound.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.430
And if we ask those same questions about satisfaction,
I think we'd actually come to very different

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.030
answers, even though happiness and satisfaction
are so closely linked in their meanings in

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.130
English language.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.110
And this question is really interesting to
answer at this particular time in my life.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.850
Right now I have custody of my daughter legally
for just 15 days.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.239
I've flown to the South of France with my
girlfriend whom I'm very much in love with.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.820
So I'm here with my girlfriend, under the
palm trees, on the beach, in an ostentatiously

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.950
beautiful part of the world, living a lifestyle
that many people might aspire to, or might

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.130
associate with the highest happiness possible.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.600
This is sort of the land where there are flowers
in bloom all around me, birds singing in the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.210
trees and we do indeed get to swim in the
azure ocean, these sorts of things.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.329
Although if it were not for my daughter, I
would be doing none of it, because these are

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.479
not my priorities in life, this is not what
motivates me.

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.530
I would never go on vacation; that's why I
would never go on a beach vacation of any

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.530
kind.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.369
If it weren't for my daughter, and these these
strange circumstances.

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.100
So the question of what is happiness and how
it shapes the behavior of other human beings

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.990
around me, and how it does and doesn't shape
my behavior, is something that's been on my

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.729
mind, along with the overweening questions
of duty, honor, and obligation, because obviously

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.550
my relationship with my daughter is very much
in my mind (day by day and in looking ahead

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.030
to the months and years in the future we're
trying to plan for, in trying to plan my education

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.490
and career for).

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.530
Many people watching this video will expect
me to answer (many people who are regular

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.251
viewers of mine, people who have known me
for a few years to whatever extent)… they're

00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:32.070
probably expecting an answer that either comes
out of Schopenhauer's school of thought Schopenhauer's

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.980
school of philosophy (which I do actually
have some videos on) or reflecting my background

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.501
in Buddhism and Buddhist philosophy.

00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:43.470
I was a scholar of Buddhism for many years
(I like to say 10 years for round numbers;

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.220
I want to think about how many years it was)…
especially Theravada Buddhism.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.220
I learned to read Pali.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.842
I did a lot of original scholarship and lived
in Buddhist countries and so on.

00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:56.450
And you can say, to make a long story short,
that both the philosopy of Arthur Schopenhauer

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.840
and the philosophy of Buddhism at its core
(Theravada Buddhism especially) really do

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.590
depict happiness as a false God, as something
you should not plan your life around, as something

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:17.450
you should not allow to distort your goals
(as an intellectual or simply as a man).

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.090
That's not really the main message or theme
I'd want to reflect on here, although I'll

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.450
come back to it, because there there's some
sense in which my involvement with Buddhism

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.372
and my involvement with the philosophy of
Schopenhauer reflects certain aspects of my

00:03:28.372 --> 00:03:30.180
character.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.290
But you know, the people who are really close
to me, the people who know me in life and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:42.120
not just on YouTube, they see me in circumstances
where other people would be struggling, where

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.460
other people would be suffering, where other
people were miserable, and I'm ebullient.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.130
Ebullient meaning really happy; happy and
smiling and laughing and even singing.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.900
My girlfriend and I went through a situation
in an airport recently, it was actually Bangkok

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.650
Airport; we flew via Bangkok Airport coming
here to France.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.410
And it was it was a disaster at the airport;
it wasted about three-and-a-half hours of

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.600
our lives; it was a horrible horrible situation
at the airport.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.010
And I never stopped smiling.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.230
I never stopped laughing.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.499
I was really kind of buoyed up by it and joyous
in dealing with it.

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:25.840
And, again, that's a side of my character,
you'd really have to know me to see it, you

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.789
have to live with me or work with me to see
it.

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.470
You'd never see it on YouTube or you'd never
get that sense from reading my essays, or

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.819
reading my written work, or even reading book-length
works from me.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:45.139
I respond to those kinds of challenges not
with phony optimism, not with a contrived

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.960
cheerfulness; I'm really, actually happy in
dealing with it.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.650
And I do have more extreme examples of that,
too.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.099
I can think of there's one situation where
somebody was threatening to kill me was really

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.259
a credible threat somebody, was threatening
to murder me.

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.479
And I was smiling and laughing and happy and
so on.

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.430
If anything I had to try to behave less happy
than I was in dealing with it.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.069
It wasn't contrived, I really felt that way.

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.639
The only philosopher I know to talk about
this (this aspect of my life, and I think

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.729
it's an aspect of other people's lives in
general) is actually the philosopher Max Stirner,

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.599
who also has a… there's a video on this
channel about his philosophy.

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.249
Max Stirner is the only guy I can remember
who talks about the obduracy of children and

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:37.969
the sense of oneself that develops when you
face up to challenges when you defy things

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.120
that maybe at first as a child seemed impossible
to defy.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.439
Stirner talks about the fact that when you're
a child, presuming that your parents beat

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:47.439
you…

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:51.219
Not everyone is beaten by their parents but
millions of us are…

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:56.090
You know, as soon as the child figures out
the look in the parent's eye that means you

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.559
are going to be beaten, then the look in the
eye is more terrifying than the stick or the

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:07.030
fist, because you know what that look in their
eye means.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.439
First you learn to fear the stick, then you
learn to fear the fist, then you learn to

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.610
fear the look in a person's eye.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.150
But then, as childhood goes on and you develop
more of an awareness of yourself, of your

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.849
own strength, of your own tenacity, of your
own own obduracy, of your own will; then you

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:31.569
move on, and you learn to feel contempt for
the threat, the look in the eye, the fist,

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:32.719
the stick.

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:37.090
Then you learn to appreciate a sense of your
own strength, of your own ability to overcome

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.469
that challenge.

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:45.139
The awareness that you can be whipped and
you can be beaten, and you're stronger than

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:46.139
that.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.139
And even if you weep that the tears are meaningless
and fleeting and so on.

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:55.360
I remember Max Stirner talking about the psychology
of childhood; he had some reflections on a

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.550
very peculiar form of happiness that, you
know, you might call thriving on misery.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.190
But this sense of your own strength, this
sense of your own obduracy, this sense that

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.919
you can overcome this challenge that's in
front of you, and of being buoyed up by it,

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.319
of being happy about it.

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:17.120
That's an element of my character that certainly
came out during this strange situation at

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.539
the airport… three and a half hours of misery
at the airport, but I was not miserable.

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:27.069
My girlfriend was really asking me, you know,
my girlfriend was asking me how should she

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:29.080
behave.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.389
She said, look, do you want me to pretend
to be happy?

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:34.770
I said, no, don't pretend: I'm not pretending.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:43.819
I said, for me, I have a liberating feeling
of doing the best I can.

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:48.629
And doing the best you can means different
things to different people.

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:54.669
But as long as I am doing the best I can,
I know I can't do anything better than this,

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:55.669
so I don't suffer at all.

00:07:55.669 --> 00:07:59.240
I'm not standing there in the airport worried
like, "Oh, am I going to miss my flight?

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.159
It's going to be all my fault."

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:09.369
I'm doing everything I can, and then beyond
that, I have that peculiar low-level joy described

00:08:09.369 --> 00:08:16.759
described by Max Stirner of knowing that I
don't fear the fist, and I don't fear the

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:23.069
rod, and I don't fear the look in the other
person's eye that brings those threats with

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:25.729
them or what have you.

00:08:25.729 --> 00:08:30.599
I enjoy the feeling of my own capacity to
cope, if you like.

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:38.339
And that is a durable form of happiness that
I have with me always and that I've experienced

00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:42.630
in a lot of really extreme situations; including,
you know, threats of violence and people threatening

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.870
to kill me, or threats that have to do with
my livelihood or, you know, impacting my life

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:53.860
in some really significant way otherwise.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.660
And I guess for people who don't feel it,
it's difficult to describe.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.070
And I guess for people who don't understand
it, looking in from the outside, they might

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:07.820
perceive me as reckless, but actually what
I'm doing is not reckless at all, it's perfectly

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.959
self-controlled.

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:14.519
And I would say further, I only feel that
way in situations where the nature of the

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:17.020
crisis is not my fault.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.750
So I don't feel guilty for anything that's
going wrong at the airport: none of it's my

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.190
fault, and so on.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.420
It would be much much different, obviously,
if I were in a situation where I was taking

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.190
care of my daughter, and there was a problem
that was my fault.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:36.170
Then you have feelings of guilt and responsibility,
and I'd be aware of my own daughter's inability

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:41.490
to cope, which is very different from that
sense of joy in my own ability to cope.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:47.600
So that is one sense, the ability to thrive
on misery, the ability to overcome obstacles

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:54.519
and have a feeling of one's own obduracy,
and being aware of one's own fearlessness

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:58.639
in dealing with problems that used to cause
fear (even if they were only things you would

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:01.779
have feared in childhood, or maybe things
you would have feared when you were younger

00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:05.630
and more inexperienced as a teenager, in your
early twenties, whatever the case may be).

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:12.400
You can think of your own examples here.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.640
But there is still some sense in which I do
identify with the critique of happiness presented

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.230
by Arthur Schopenhauer, presented by Theravada
Buddhism.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:28.579
I find myself walking the streets here of
the Côte d'Azur, this beautiful part of France,

00:10:28.579 --> 00:10:36.480
and yes, the idea that somebody would be captivated
by the sight of a yacht, of an expensive boat,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.490
and think that they want that to be happy
[is absurd to me]; we're passed on the street

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:45.350
by very expensive cars (Ferraris and Porsches
and what have you), the idea that somebody

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:51.230
would see that and desire that and would take
that on as a goal; the idea that someone like

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.699
myself might come here and then go back to
Canada and feel motivated that they have to

00:10:55.699 --> 00:10:59.690
save up money so that one day they can be
the person in the yacht or they can be the

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:04.639
person in the fancy car with an apartment
here in the South of France, on the beach,

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:12.319
that is contemptible to me in a sense that's
shallow and profound at the same time.

00:11:12.319 --> 00:11:15.750
But I can't even say that is something I believe,
or something that I have chosen.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:20.270
I really think that's an aesthetic difference
between myself and other people more than

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.459
it even as a moral difference or a choice.

00:11:23.459 --> 00:11:27.790
None of those things; I'm not drawn to any
of those things; I never have been and I think

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.199
I never could be.

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:35.060
When I first enrolled in University (the University
of Toronto), my major was economics.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:41.740
When people asked me why, I answered, because
I wanted to study the philosophy of poverty.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.240
I've always been drawn to poverty.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.450
I've always been drawn to the devastation
of war; the post-war struggle, the struggle

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.190
to reconstruct a society after a disaster,
war or famine.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.980
I've always been concerned about genocide,
including the slow-motion genocide about against

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:01.259
Canada's own people, questions of endangered
languages enduring, and the injustice is of

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:06.680
the British Empire in creating Canada, the
country I was born into, and so on.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.639
But, we can talk about those things philosophically
we can talk about them politically, but I

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:15.949
can also just say there's a level on which
it's aesthetic.

00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:19.300
And the truth is my parents brought me to
France when I was a child, they brought me

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:25.660
to Italy and few other parts of Europe; I
saw all this splendor, and to me there was

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.990
nothing splendid in it.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:35.509
And I was never interested in having a life
lived in pursuit of those creature comforts.

00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:41.360
I wanted a life that was full of suffering
and defined by suffering but where it was

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.449
meaningful suffering.

00:12:43.449 --> 00:12:49.510
I wanted to live a meaningful life as I defined
it.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.050
And I did that.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:56.970
I can tell you honestly that if I die tomorrow
or if I died yesterday, I did live a meaningful

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.709
life already, by my own definition.

00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:03.420
And now I'm moving on to a very new and different
chapter of my life.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.090
I say this as the floor is covered with toys
for my daughter.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:13.440
We spent about eight hours today with my daughter,
going to the beach and sitting on this floor,

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.269
playing with these toys, and played some video
games, too, and so on.

00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:23.079
It's taken on a new dimension and a new direction.

00:13:23.079 --> 00:13:30.180
But no, my life has never been about happiness,
and that's both the short and the long answer

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:30.570
to that question.
