Hey. This video is about a kind of interesting
linguistic and cultural factoid about the

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.950
Japanese language, maybe especially interesting
if you're vegetarian or vegan, but useful

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.050
for anyone who is studying Japanese these
days. Just since the year 2006 a unique meaning

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.329
has been assigned to "Herbivore" in Japanese,
and, for me, studying the language, it was

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.359
quite unexpected. The phrase in Japanese here
is, "Herbivore Man". And if you look at the

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.100
words that make up the phrase there's no trickery,
there's nothing vague or poetic, there's no

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:46.429
double entendre there, it's very literally
"plant-food male person", "Herbivore Man".

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:52.629
But just recently, just since the year 2006,
two related terms have emerged in Japanese

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:59.890
that have a kind of dynamic commentary on
how gender-roles are changing. "Herbivore

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:07.190
Man" and "Carnivore Woman". Now the root idea
here… at first I assumed that it was used

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.570
in an insulting way, that it was used to denigrate
or insult men… to say that a man was a "Herbivore

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.870
Man" was to say that he was not behaving like
a carnivore, not meaning eating meat, but

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.700
that he was failing to act like a hunter,
especially with the idea being that pursuing

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.000
women, trying to start relationships with
women or have many girlfriends, or what-have-you,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.221
was a "carnivorous" behavior (initiating relationships).
But, interestingly there too, the idea of

00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:48.090
being a herbivore, it's not that you're failing
to sleep around, it's not that you're failing

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.470
to be a Lothario (女たらし)… I'm trying
to find polite ways to say this in English…

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.330
interestingly, the idea of the herbivore man
is that he's avoiding the attention of women

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.340
who are pursuing him (so there are women who
would like to make a husband out of him),

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:19.060
but he's a guy who is not interested in getting
married, or even having a girlfriend. It's

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.020
a bit complex, it's not just that he's avoiding
commitment, it's not just that he doesn't

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.970
like women…&nbsp;I guess you could say in English,
it's that he's "opted out of the rat race".

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.700
He's not competing to get as much money as
possible, he's not competing to have as many

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.480
girlfriends as possible, and he's not competing
to get married and start a family, either.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.740
But again, interestingly, it's not used in
a way that's directly insulting to the man,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.630
because still there's the idea that this guy
is desirable, that there are women interested

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.480
in him, but he's failing to play the game.
So that's interesting: as a cultural concept

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.010
I've never seen that combination of values
in any other language. And now, by contrast,

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.280
"Carnivore Woman", here the idea is that the
woman is playing the role of the hunter, of

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.319
the lion, of the carnivore, and this idea,
again, has nothing to do with diet, with what

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.350
you're eating --that the woman is initiating,
that she is seeking a husband, and perhaps

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:29.760
that she is "in the rat race" in a competitive
sense. And, in this case, it always is denigrating

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.349
and insulting, because for a woman to display
these behaviors in Japanese society is considered

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:44.490
snobbish, greedy and inappropriate for their
gender-role. So, again, it reflects a lot

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.390
of really odd things about how language, culture,
gender roles, etc., are changing in the 21st

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.130
century. And despite the fact that it has
the words "herbivore" and "carnivore" involved,

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:03.409
it has absolutely nothing to do with vegetarianism
and veganism.
