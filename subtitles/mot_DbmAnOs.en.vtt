00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:10.510
I get fan-mail. I do. And sometimes the fan-mail
is so misguided that it has about the same

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.029
impact on me as hate-mail. [Laughs]
Let's get into it.

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.279
Question number 1... I get this a lot... I
get this [with] all kinds of variations on

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.579
a theme. "What is the big deal with learning
ancient languages anyway?" "Richard Gombrich

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:36.400
says I can learn Pali in two weeks." "My Dharma-master
says he learned Sanskrit in three months."

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:45.090
Blah, blah, blah. Oh, yeah. [Laughs]
There are a lot, a lot of scams going, in

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:54.460
terms of language ability, and, I mean, people
in academia really like to just add one more

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.650
line to their résumé. Nothing's easier to
add to your C.V. than, "Fluent in _____",

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:10.200
especially if you're at a university where
nobody can check your credentials. If you're

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.920
the only guy on campus who says he knows Sanskrit,
who is going to tell you that you don't know

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.530
Sanskrit?
It's very, very hard to really gain ability

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.509
in any language, living or dead, and it's
very, very easy to fake it in most academic

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.670
contexts, and in most religious contexts.
As soon as you've got religious hierarchy,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:42.399
people are not allowed to question you, or
you're the only one allowed to ask questions.

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:49.020
I remember there was a Buddhist monk trying
to get a PhD in my university in Canada (as

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.490
a student) and... y'know, I'd read his work,
I'd read an essay by him, and my professor,

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.409
the head of the department [sic], commented
that he could tell [the monk] wasn't really

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.650
reading the original text, he wasn't really
looking at the Pali or the other ancient languages

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.560
involved. And [the professor] said very simply
that he could tell [the monk] isn't really

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.560
doing the reading, because "he doesn't find
problems with it". Interesting comment, because

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.250
that professor, his own work related to Japanese
and old Chinese, but it stuck with me because

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:38.400
it's true. People who do the reading --the
real reading-- always find problems in the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.160
text. And that's true even if you're reading
Shakespeare, and Shakespeare's use of English

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.030
is not that different from modern English,
but there are a lot of problems. There are

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.900
a lot of points where the text doesn't make
sense, or you're left wondering, "Did this

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.030
word used to be some other word?", even in
Shakespeare. And certainly if you're looking

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.490
at ancient Greek, Latin, any other example
like that.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.710
So, uh, no, the vast majority of people who
say that they know these languages (whether

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.150
they say they learned it in two weeks or three
months, whether they say they learned it in

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.490
a cave in Tibet, or they say they learned
it in a classroom in London, England), no

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.590
matter what they say, it's somewhere between
fraud and a tremendous exaggeration, most

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.280
of the time. I've had so many cases [in which]
people with PhDs correspond with me, and I've

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.300
read their work, and I say to them, "Look,
I can tell you're not reading the original

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.720
text, because what you're saying here --the
philosophical claim you're making-- if you

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.900
had read the Pali you would know this doesn't
relate to the original text in any way. So

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.610
you get a lot of "broken telephone" going
on, you get a lot of this scam of, "Oh, I'm

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.430
gonna quote something that somebody else said
indirectly about the ancient text, and I'm

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.380
gonna pretend it's my opinion based on my
original research, or my original translation".

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:10.230
Uuugh, depressing. And then when you wrap
it up in a robe and start asking for donations,

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.260
and start telling people that you can cure
cancer with your magical meditation techniques,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.500
man, it gets off the rails quick. The worst
aspects of human nature start to show up before

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.320
you know it.
How much of any language can you learn in

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.490
two weeks? Two weeks is about enough time,
if you remember the old days when you would

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.380
actually buy an album on a piece of plastic,
two weeks is about enough time, when you're

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.870
a kid, to learn all the lyrics on an album.
Maybe you got a new favorite album, you listen

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.500
to it every day, and after two weeks, you
know all the lyrics. But even then, there

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.230
would be some phrases that you can't quite
hear correctly, that you can't quite break

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:08.720
down into words, where you don't quite know
what the singer is saying. Most of us, growing

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.770
up, we have the experience of thinking we
know the lyrics to a song, and then years

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.430
later finding out what the words actually
were. If we're talking about a foreign language,

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.440
then there's no comparison. If you go out
now and buy an album in a language you don't

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:33.390
speak (especially from a different language-family,
Chinese, Cree, you name it, a totally alien

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.130
language), even if you listen to that album
again and again and again for two weeks, many

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:46.152
times a day, even if you try to memorize it,
you're not going to be able to break down

00:05:46.152 --> 00:05:50.350
the words into parts, you're not going to
be able to know what's going on phonetically,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:57.330
gramatically, or otherwise. So you'll really
just have a set of familiar sounds that you

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:03.180
can't do much with. And, with Buddhism, that's
pretty close to the type of language learning

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:11.290
that most people do. You may learn to chant
what are basically songs, you may learn to

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:18.389
memorize and repeat a bunch of syllables,
and they may be badly mispronounced... most

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:23.030
of the Buddhist traditions today, it's pretty
hard to figure out what they're saying.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:31.600
I remember Filliozat told me they had some
kind of annual Buddhist party at one of the

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.360
Buddhist institutions in Paris, and they would
invite Buddhist monks from every consulate

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.840
and culture that was in Paris, and try to
get them to all chant in unison, and each

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:50.230
of the representatives had a different, terrible
mispronunciation of the same Pali text. So

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:57.360
it was a complete cacophany, you couldn't
hear anything clearly, out of tune, out of

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.960
pace, out of step, it sounded awful. She said
she showed up to witness this spectacle for

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.360
several years in a row. Not that much to do
if you're a scholar of Buddhism living in

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.979
Paris, I think. I'm not sure if that's a sad
story or a happy story. What was my point?

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:22.370
You can listen to an album in your own language
and learn all the lyrics in two weeks. You

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.040
can't do that with an album in a foreign language,
[not] even if it's a foreign language pretty

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.040
closely related to your own. And to do that
in a foreign language that today is ancient,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.180
doesn't have anyone alive that can speak it,
good luck.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:42.100
Learning a language, really being able to
read an ancient language, is very hard work.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.650
Being able to read philosophy in a language
is very hard work, and you know, in three

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:52.590
months, even if we're talking about an easy
language --well, let's say Chinese-- in three

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:57.270
months you can learn how to say, "Excuse me,
where's the bathroom?", and "How much does

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:03.139
this cost?", and other useful phrases like
that, in Chinese, but how are you going to

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:11.850
read, debate or dispute philosophy in Chinese,
after three months? Impossible.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:17.470
Um, with that having been said, I always used
to tell people, "Hey, I never learned how

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.440
to say 'where's the bathroom?' in Pali". [Laughs]
But I did learn how to say "Where's the bathroom"

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:29.750
in Lao, Thai, Cambodian, and the other modern
languages I studied.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:36.550
Alright, question number two... whoo... this
one, man, the way this kind of question is

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.460
phrased, you never know, it's always a mix
of fan-mail and hate-mail. "Why would you

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.870
even want to get into a PhD program?" "You
are much better off working independently,

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:53.850
on your own." "Life is so much harder with
a PhD...", "Let me tell you how hard my own

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:58.529
life is...". Uuuu.
I got two or three different messages like

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:04.790
that [just] this month, from people who are
today professors. And, I mean, part of it

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:12.020
is that everyone like the opportunity to complain,
and a lot of professors feel that they can

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:19.850
write to me and tell me how hard their life
is. Um, I don't even know if they're trying

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:25.550
to console me, or console themselves. I think
they're trying to make themselves feel better

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:32.130
about what they did with their lives.
Y'know, over the years, I talked to different

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:38.440
specialists about the option of doing an M.A.,
doing a PhD, partly because I already had

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:44.020
the proven ability to do research in various
languages and contexts. "Well, look, I've

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.270
been out here for so many years, this is the
type of stuff I've already done, it would

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.320
be pretty easy for me to go into an M.A. or
a PhD program and do some kind of work, and

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.370
see what doors that could open to me."
The flip side of that is that the institutions

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:04.160
I was talking to could often offer absolutely
nothing in return. This actually comes back

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:12.070
to the first question, a lot of these universities...
I'd just ask a really simple question, like,

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:18.690
"Oh, well, you say you teach Pali, what's
the name of the professor who teaches Pali,

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:24.220
because you don't have anyone listed on your
staff with competence in Pali? Who is actually

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.500
teaching the course?"
Even with Thai; one university I talked to,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:33.810
it was like, y'know, "Okay, so you say you
have a degree in Thai studies, who is the

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:41.529
professor teaching Thai? You have no one on
staff listed doing it."

00:10:41.529 --> 00:10:46.770
A lot of universities are eager to take your
money and provide you with absolutely no education

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:53.140
in return. And the sad thing is that when
you're talking about Buddhism, or Asian Studies,

00:10:53.140 --> 00:11:00.950
the things that interested me, none of them
lead to any money, so there's this sense of

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:06.420
"Can't we be honest? Can't we be co-operative?
Can't we be honest with each other and ourselves,

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.170
when there's no money involved?"
If you sit down at a meeting where everyone's

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:16.490
just there to make money, I understand why
they're going to lie and cheat and rob and

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:23.100
pillage. I understand why people are dishonest
when there's money involved, but, wow, from

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.941
the language work to the humanitarian work,
it's amazing that you sit down with people

00:11:27.941 --> 00:11:37.100
who have no way of making money out of the
situation, but they still act like a den of

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:42.000
thieves. Sad.
Uh... yeah... y'know the other side of it

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.630
is that these people who write in to me, who
themselves have PhDs and are professors and

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:53.400
so on, I think they're just used to talking
to people who became, y'know, chartered accountants.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:59.470
And I guess they're just really used to saying
to those people, "You're better-off without

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:05.580
a PhD, just living as an accountant, making
money..." --and maybe that's true. Maybe they

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:12.080
know people who became accountants and dentists
and got normal professions and so on, but

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:18.580
it's tremendously crass and insensitive. Wait,
who do you think you're talking to? Y'know,

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.110
I got a message a couple of days ago that
was really specifying that I had lived a better

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:30.480
life out in Laos and Cambodia, doing my own
thing, than this guy had lived with a PhD

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:40.010
and a series of academic posts. Well... [Laughs]
do you want to trade places with me? [Laughs]

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:49.490
No matter how tough your conditions are, the
real source of stress is not knowing where

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:54.720
your next meal is coming from, it's not knowing
where your next paycheck is coming from. It's

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.580
knowing that even if you have food and shelter
today, you don't know where your home is going

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:06.580
to be three months from now. You don't know
how you're going to pay rent in the very short

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.880
term. And, you know, for a lot of my adult
life, since I finished my B.A. --the only

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.630
diploma I've still got-- that has been true
of me.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.779
And, no, salaried academics... I sympathize
to some extent with the ways in which they

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:26.660
feel their lives are hell, but they haven't
coped with that stress. They don't know what

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:33.269
it's like to go to a hospital in Vientiane,
Laos, and to communicate with the hospital

00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:41.620
staff in Lao, to try to address whatever medical
emergency you've got. They don't know what

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:49.880
that's like, and they don't know what it's
like to do that when you're flat broke. [Laughs]

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:56.940
I payed the Lao rates, man, when I had to
get medical care in Vientiane. I didn't have

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:03.610
any fancy, foreigners' coverage, and I paid
the same low, low prices that local Lao citizens

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:09.320
did, and I got the same quality of treatment,
too, let me tell you. [Laughs]

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.231
But, seriously, that's also why I wanted to
do what I did relatively young in life. I

00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:20.680
had a couple of professors who were inspirations
to me in a kind of negative sense. One of

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.720
my professors, you know, he had never spent
any time in Asia, he lived his whole life

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:33.769
in Canada, and, y'know, I thought, I don't
want to go down that path, and then be in

00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:39.300
the situation of just starting to explore
Asia when I'm 50 years old, 60 years old,

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:45.670
of doing what's at the core of my research
interests when I'm too old to really do it,

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:52.140
when I'm too old to take risks. Go out, get
malaria, break your leg, get into life-and-death

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:57.270
situations, [Laughs] do the humanitarian work
and so on. You know, I realized that I wanted

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:01.760
to that "now or never". And, of course, I'm
very glad that I did.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:09.899
One of my other professors, I remember he
said to me, at the end of my B.A., he said,

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:16.710
"Look, go to Asia now, go to the field, do
it now, because when you come back," this

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:23.890
was his opinion, "There are two types of guys
in academia: there are the guys who went there,

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:29.450
did that, rolled up their sleeves, and they
know what it is, they know what the work in

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:37.700
the field is...", and then he just paused
and waved a hand. And I filled in his sentence,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:42.860
and I said, "And then there are the guys who
never even tried". He smiled and he agreed

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.850
with me.
So, even if those professors were an inspiration

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:59.450
to me in a negative sense, um, y'know, I really
appreciated that I went out and directly got

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.930
--in the field-- something that other people
would have to jump through hoops for years

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.960
and years to get to.
And the world was changing so fast during

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.880
that decade, that the very few opportunities
I had wouldn't exist anymore.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:20.940
I can also say that, to my chagrin, I remember
I showed up at what used to be called the

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:27.070
National University of Ceylon, the Peradeniya
University in Sri Lanka, I showed up at this

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:32.193
university, one of the very few universities
that really teaches Pali as a subject. I put

00:16:32.193 --> 00:16:38.070
down on the table, just at the start of the
discussion, a notebook that had my handwritten

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:47.730
work in Pali, and I had handwriting in literary
Sinhalese, Burmese, Cambodian, Lao (I didn't

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:54.110
just write Pali in Roman orthography, I had
developed my handwriting up to a certain level

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:58.940
in all those traditions), and I sat down and
talked to the professors about the possibility

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:04.579
of studying there. And they looked at what
I'd written in Pali, and they said right away,

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:09.199
"No, no, no, no, you wouldn't be able to take
any of the courses here, you're already much

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:17.030
too advanced for even our level 4 course".
And, you know, I wasn't flattered, and I didn't

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:24.170
feel good about it, and I tried to laugh it
off and say, "No, if I studied here, I would

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:28.980
want to have the experience of being in these
classes, and hearing the language spoken and

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.140
so on". They looked at me, really aghast,
because they thought... they thought correctly

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:38.470
that I just didn't realize how awful the classes
were. [Laughs]

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:44.970
And at that time, really, I was still pretty
close to being a beginner myself. The sentences

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:51.200
I had written out were no great accomplishment,
in terms of Pali comprehension, but I'd worked

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:57.900
hard for a couple of years at that point.
And a couple of years of hard work, alone,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:04.549
independently, is indeed more valuable than
four years or six years in an academic system

00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:11.250
that wastes a lot of your time, wastes a lot
of your money, puts you in a situation where

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:16.010
you can't work at your own pace, even if your
own pace would be faster than what the class

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:23.720
is doing.
[Question 3:] Man, I get this question all

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:31.400
the time. "Thank you so much for your blog.
Thank you for your articles. I am just finishing

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:37.720
my university diploma, and I want to do exactly
the same thing you did. I find your story

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:44.490
so inspirational... I want to buy a plane
ticket to Laos...&nbsp;etc. etc."

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:53.570
I get a couple of different people each year...
maybe about 3 different guys a year --and

00:18:53.570 --> 00:19:02.560
they're always male, they're always guys--
who have this reaction to my work. And the

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:11.780
feeling, you know, it's like if you were a
jazz singer, and every song you sing is about

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:20.361
how [Laughs] women and alcohol and singing
jazz have ruined your life, [Laughs] and every

00:19:20.361 --> 00:19:25.820
day people come up to you and say, "Yeah,
yeah, yeah, I love your album, I love your

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.419
songs, you know, I want to be just like you
when I grow up, I want to sing jazz and get

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:37.740
involved with women and alcohol and all of
the things you're warning me about".

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:46.120
[Laughs] You know, I'd like to think that
everything I've written is a really strong

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:55.780
warning against anyone trying to do what I
did. And it's both a warning about what was

00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:02.460
impossible at the time, and, also, my articles
are very careful to warn you about how things

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:08.130
have changed in even just a few years.
When I arrived in Vientiane, the capital city

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:14.530
of Laos, the whole city had, I think, two
traffic lights. In the downtown city there

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:22.900
were two traffic lights, and there were zero
bank machines. Electric banking didn't exist

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:27.530
yet. And when people would ask me, "Excuse
me, where's the nearest international bank

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:37.340
machine?", I would proudly say to them, "Thailand,
you have to cross the border to use an international

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:41.740
bank machine".
That changed. Today, the whole country is

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:48.190
wired up. For better or worse, they've got
traffic lights, bank machines and all the

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:57.090
rest of it. And, um... the real opportunities
were probably about 20 years before I arrived.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:05.660
I met an old German guy who showed up in Laos
maybe 20 years before I did, and at that stage

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:12.950
they were so desperate for skilled help of
any kind, y'know, if you just showed up with

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:21.650
good intentions, you could find some kind
of work to do. The culture of corruption closes

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:30.270
in in a country, much like those electronic
networks, and those opportunities disappear.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:37.500
And, y'know, the potential of one person to
make a positive difference disappears along

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:44.510
with it --because I wasn't there to make money.
So, in many ways, you know, even though it's

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:53.031
such a short span of time, the Laos I knew
no longer exists. A book that is both inspirational

00:21:53.031 --> 00:22:01.309
and a warning, Richard Gombrich's very first
book, "Precept and Practice", that book describes

00:22:01.309 --> 00:22:06.842
a whole world in Sri Lanka that does not exist
anymore. It doesn't exist in the city, it

00:22:06.842 --> 00:22:11.760
doesn't exist in the countryside. And I remember,
the last time that I talked to him face to

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.660
face, I praised that book to him, I said that,
you know, that book was an inspiration to

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:25.120
me when I was starting out, and he said, "Today,
nobody could do that research", because what

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:32.470
he studied, in Sri Lanka, is no longer there
to be studied. And he had the money and institutional

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:38.630
banking to do the research --sorry, [Laughs]
he had the money and institutional backing

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:44.929
to do the research, whereas I worked completely
independently, and my support was whatever

00:22:44.929 --> 00:22:50.669
part-time job I could get along the way to
put a roof over my head.

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:56.760
That's the whole story, folks. Stop sending
me fan-mail that sounds like hate-mail. [Laughs]

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:06.760
I've got 12 years of this, man... seriously,
already, like, 2003? I got fan mail back then.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:06.980
[Laughs]
