00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:34.530 align:start position:0%
did that as I hopped off the bike the
 

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.750 align:start position:0%
did that as I hopped off the bike the

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
bike then a half second later it lifted
up<00:23:38.880><c> off</c><00:23:39.090><c> the</c><00:23:39.300><c> ground</c><00:23:39.510><c> and</c><00:23:39.930><c> that</c><00:23:40.440><c> was</c><00:23:40.620><c> just</c>

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:40.770 align:start position:0%
up off the ground and that was just
 

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.860 align:start position:0%
up off the ground and that was just
because<00:23:41.100><c> my</c><00:23:41.310><c> weight</c><00:23:41.640><c> had</c><00:23:42.120><c> come</c><00:23:42.330><c> off</c><00:23:42.510><c> the</c><00:23:42.690><c> bike</c>

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:42.870 align:start position:0%
because my weight had come off the bike
 

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
because my weight had come off the bike
so<00:23:43.440><c> suddenly</c><00:23:43.830><c> there's</c><00:23:44.400><c> some</c><00:23:44.640><c> springiness</c><00:23:45.120><c> and</c>

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:45.330 align:start position:0%
so suddenly there's some springiness and

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:51.210 align:start position:0%
bike itself lifted up
 

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.659 align:start position:0%

00:23:55.579 --> 00:23:55.589 align:start position:0%
reached out with my hand behind me and
 

00:23:55.589 --> 00:23:59.269 align:start position:0%
reached out with my hand behind me and

00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
grabbed the frame of the bike and then
 

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:02.209 align:start position:0%
grabbed the frame of the bike and then
