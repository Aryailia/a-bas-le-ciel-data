00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:08.430
I wanted to say a few words about endangered
languages, but [first]... hey, I finally got

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.870
a copy of the 千字文.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.540
Talking to 101 people who work in bookstores
who have never heard of that book finally

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.350
came to a conclusion.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.170
I exaggerate only slightly.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.250
Uh, arright...

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.820
You know, I had an interesting conversation
just yesterday with someone whose first language

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.379
is Hokkien.

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.460
I guess I could say...

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.710
I could make two lists of languages, one being
languages that I have studied, and one being

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.460
languages that I tried to study.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.880
On that second list, I would include Hokkien.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.760
I tried to study that language in formal university
programs.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.710
I spoke to professors in England, Canada,
the U.S., and, of course, in Taiwan.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.180
To make a long story short, it turned out
to be impossible.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.180
Uh...

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.350
I did enough research on it to be annoying.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.890
Some of the illustrations and diagrams from
that work are posted on my blog and they actually

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.020
still get a lot of readers (compared to anything
I've ever worked on) because there are a lot

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.820
of people who grew up speaking that language
and when they search on the internet they

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.500
barely find a trace of it, especially if they're
searching in English, of course.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.510
It is a language that's disappearing.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.850
It is a language that is in danger now.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.509
Just yesterday I had a conversation with someone
whose parents and grandparents spoke it as

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.780
their native language, but she, in the younger
generation, grew up being educated only in

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.399
the language that had a chance of making money,
and those are primarily (1) standard Chinese

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.659
(a.k.a. "Modern Standard Mandarin"), and (2)
English.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.149
I was having the conversation with her in
English.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.729
Like many discussions of endangered languages,
it started with her having the outlook that,

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.630
"No, this language wasn't endangered".

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.200
[Insisting that] it was still spoken in many
places, and that if I knew more about it,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.000
I would realize that it is still vibrant in
this place and that place and so on.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.440
After just a few minutes, she completely switched
her perspective on the matter, and was agreeing

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.959
with me, that yes, this language was endangered,
and yes it would probably disappear completely

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.659
within the next 100 years, as her grandparents'
generation disappeared.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.659
When I showed her the illustrations from my
own website (from my blog) she remarked with

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.450
amazement many times, she had never seen the
language written.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.310
She had never seen it studied.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.230
She had never seen it formally taught.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.239
And I said to her, very simply, if you have
a language that nobody is teaching, that nobody

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.569
is reading, that nobody is writing, that's
[why] it will disappear in the next 100 years.

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.920
You have, very simply, all the ingredients
there for language extinction.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:14.360
But you also have the awareness, on her part,
as someone whose family [had been] traditionally

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.450
native speakers of this language, she has
the awareness that they made a choice: [her]

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.829
family and, more broadly, [her] people, chose
(not in a circumstance of being conquered

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.069
and forced at the end of a bayonet, the way
the British Empire operated, in Australia,

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.730
in Canada, and in many other places in the
world), but they made a choice to switch to

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.510
languages that had a better chance of earning
money for the younger generation's future.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:52.120
[This is] a conscious and deliberate choice
to let the language fade out of use in their

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.030
own family.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.430
And, um, she remarked several times that it
was sad, and she had never thought about it

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.430
before.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.900
She had never thought about how sad it was
that she was herself a member of the last

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.530
generation to know this language --and her
own ability in the language, of course, is

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.219
limited to a few isolated words and phrases.

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.670
And she's going to witness this fade out into
nothing.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.959
And whatever significance the language had
for the history of the world, whatever potential

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.020
it could have had for the future, is going
to fade out.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:34.310
But a language like Min-nan (a language like
Hokkien) is at the opposite extreme from languages

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.340
that are indigenous to Canada (probably [we
could also say the same of] languages that

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.050
are indigenous to Australia and other examples).

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:48.080
Um, y'know there was a time when Hokkien was
actually a very active international language.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.370
It still has radio programs giving the news
and conversation.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.300
It still has television news.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.620
In the very recent past, and still today,
they have some pop songs, but they used to

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.100
have movies, music, love-songs.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.300
It was a pop language, and it crossed international
frontiers.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:15.810
It's definitely a language that united a whole
semi-circle of the Chinese-speaking world,

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.890
from the port of Xiamen down to Malaysia,
Taiwan, Singapore.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:28.410
Singapore used to have a huge population speaking
Min-nan, and today it has really disappeared.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:35.790
Singapore made a conscious decision to transition
to just standard Chinese (and English) among

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.560
the [ethnically] Chinese population.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:45.729
You know, for a language with the sort of
history that Min-nan has, the decision (consciously-made)

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.699
to switch to other languages, both at the
level of the individual family and at the

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:56.310
level of local governments like Singapore,
and, y'know, with policies that are not carried

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.761
out with swords and guns (not through brute
force), that's very, very different from the

00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:10.410
historical experience of the Cree or Ojibwe.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.900
Within Canada when I spoke to people whose
heritage was Cree, Cree was maybe the only

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.310
language large enough for people to have that
[same] delusion, that "No, there are plenty

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.680
of people who speak Cree fluently".

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.910
"No, if you say it's endangered, you're wrong,
you don't know what you're talking about."

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.169
And very often if you just talked to them
about it for a couple of minutes they would

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:37.050
make the same flip, they would make the transition
to agreeing with you, realizing, "No, look,

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.949
I just never thought about it before".

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:41.639
"Yeah, the language really is in danger."

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.830
And they would think about all the things
that a vibrant language would have going for

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.360
it, and what's missing for Cree, and what
the future might hold.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:57.069
But Cree is big enough and spread out enough
geographically that some people will refuse

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:00.580
[to accept this], they'll just get dug in
and say, "No!", and they'll point to how much

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:07.740
of the map in theory has Cree heritage, and
say "Cree is strong and vibrant and the language

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.520
can't be disappearing from the world".

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.360
I've never had that experience even with speakers
of Anishinaabe (a language we call Ojibwe

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:23.310
in English), maybe because Ojibwe is spread
out on both sides of the Canadian-U.S. border,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.810
maybe because so much of Ojibwe is spoken
in areas that are more densely populated,

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.150
in terms of contact with English.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.720
I don't know what the factors are, [but] I've
always found that they're much more aware

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:41.520
of how perilous and delicate the situation
of their language is, how close it is to extinction.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.810
I have written a bit about language extinction
before, I wrote an informal article in a very

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:52.960
informal publication, a sort of journal for
endangered language researchers and enthusiasts,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.960
and so on.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:02.280
One of the things I emphasized in that article
(which may seem like an unusual or unpopular

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:08.220
point to make) is that when you're researching
these endangered languages you have to respect

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.860
that choice, when you meet people who have
made the choice.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:18.229
I'm not saying (by any means) that native
Cree speakers had a free choice to switch

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:23.380
to English, although you will meet individuals
who will tell you that they did.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.659
They'll say, "Yeah, you know, my grandparents
spoke Cree, my parents spoke Cree, but I decided

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:31.950
I only wanted to study English, I wanted to
go to university, I wanted to get ahead",

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:36.330
and they'll sometimes tell you that they have
a brother or sister who cared more about traditional

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.260
religion, traditional language, tradition
in general.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.000
Some people, once in a while you meet people
who consciously made [this] decision.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.010
So I think the role of the outsider (of a
researcher, even of a political activist)

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:58.880
can never be seeing the future of the language
as an obligation for people who happen to

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.750
be born into those circumstances.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:08.820
I think the tremendously important thing is
to facilitate the minority of people who are

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.700
passionate about creating a future for their
native language.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:20.750
If, hypothetically, there were only 2% of
Cree people in all of Canada who wanted to

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:27.330
work hard to create a future for the Cree
language, it would be imperative, it would

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:34.152
be tremendously important to facilitate the
efforts made by those 2% of people, and --even

00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:38.860
at the level of social networking-- to get
them to meet each-other and have conferences

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:46.670
and co-operate and collaborate, because [that]
2% [and] their work will absolutely determine

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:54.360
whether or not any future generation (whether
it's 2% or 10% or 50%) has the option to participate

00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:12.500
in that language, that heritage, that culture.
