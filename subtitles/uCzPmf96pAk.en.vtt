00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.870
Hey, what's up.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:09.919
There's a difference between "digital veganism"
and real-world veganism, just as there's a

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:16.570
difference between "digital activism" and
real-world political activism.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.840
And that's okay.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.930
That's not something to feel guilty about,
that's not something to beat yourself up about.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.810
One of the questions I had coming in to me,
from some of the guys who are in Thailand

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:35.180
right now, these western entrepreneurs (in
Thailand) who are part of the online phenomenon

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:44.110
of the Thai Fruit Festival, part of this high-profile
new vegan movement; the question they sent

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.030
to me was, "Look, what can we do now?"

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.180
Given the critique I'd already presented,
given the concerns I've already raised, given

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.570
the danger that "digital veganism" is slipping
further and further away from the core concerns

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:11.570
that define veganism; given that real veganism
is not about looking good in a bikini, that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:20.250
it's not about buying an expensive bicycle
and riding it over 100 km a day in Thailand;

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.030
given that the core concerns and issues of
veganism have nothing to do with being on

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.790
[this] kind of permanent vacation, or presenting
to the world on instagram a phony life of

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:39.020
luxury, athleticism, relaxation, beauty, you
name it.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.190
Those issues are marginal to veganism at best,
what can we do now?

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.860
And I gave a really sincere answer.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.080
To be honest, I hesitated.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.630
I kind of asked myself, "Am I really gonna
give a sincere answer or not?"

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.869
I gave an answer that was both specifically
geared to digital veganism as something that

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.289
exists in its own right on Youtube, connected
to the real world, but only tenuously, and

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:16.360
I also gave an answer that specifically reflected
the geographical reality: we're talking about

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.910
a certain community of entrepreneurs, some
of whom are in Thailand, some of whom are

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.740
in California, people who have the potential
to make a difference, and people who already

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.330
are making a difference (who already are successful
in their way), but who are definitely not

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.000
connected to social and political reality
in any one place.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.550
As I've already mentioned at length, the vegans
who are in Northern Thailand have shockingly

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.680
little connection to the real-world issues
in Northern Thailand, and whether or not that's

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.940
a problem, it's also (definitely) an opportunity.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.000
So that was the question that was put to me:
what can we do now?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.291
Given the bits and pieces that we have to
work with, positively, constructively, what

00:02:58.291 --> 00:02:59.840
can we do?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.010
Given the critique, given the issues, but
also given the opportunities.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.720
Now, for "digital veganism", and for the entrepreneurs
(who are spread out all over the world), this

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.840
is my answer; at first it may seem a little
bit strange, but it reflects positive examples

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.300
that you can draw from both real-world politics
and real-world religious organizations (you

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.250
can also contrast it to negative examples
from the same two fields, politics and religion).

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:37.440
The honest answer I gave was, look, vegans
in this situation, vegans on Youtube, digital

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:46.790
vegans, they can build a news-service, they
can build a talk-show, similar to T.Y.T.,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.060
similar to The Young Turks.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.730
The Young Turks is one of the most famous
and successful news-discussion programs on

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.730
the internet.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.730
It has been around for more than ten years.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.100
You can google it really quickly.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.260
Now a lot of people might be shocked that
I said that, "Wait a minute, you're not contrasting

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.770
something real to something fake, you're just
talking about a different type of emphasis".

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:21.530
Well, um, when you have an engagement with
real-world issues (any kind of sincere reporting,

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:30.310
sincere debating, etc.), and I'm not picking
an impossibly high standard here to compare

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.650
what's going on in veganism to (The Young
Turks is a very casual format for debate and

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.750
discussion of current political issues), but
when you put up that kind of content, when

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.430
you show concern and engagement with real-world
political issues (and, of course, vegans would

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.750
not be engaged with quite the same issues
as The Young Turks, they'd have more interest

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.910
in ecology, more interest in some selection
of issues, you define your mandate however

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:05.680
you want to define it), when you come back
week after week and just show a sober, sincere

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.290
engagement with those issues, when you make
mistakes and you come back in the next episode

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.870
a week later and apologize, and have a correction
(showing, "look, we messed up last week, here

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.840
are the facts on that issue"), whatever it
is, even at that lowest level of just discussion

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.700
of the facts as they come out, what you build
is a constituency in the old-fashioned political

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.790
sense.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.450
The people who watch your program (and all
kinds of people who are not vegan will be

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.670
drawn in just because you're doing, again,
good reporting, or good discussion of what

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.610
other people have reported, good disclosure
of the facts, whatever it is you're doing)

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:51.300
if you have a fact-based program with the
vegan perspective implicitly built into that,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.430
or once-in-a-while the veganism comes to the
fore, if you just have a group of vegans doing

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.730
what The Young Turks are already doing you
will build a constituency.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:09.430
People who really are supporting your political
direction will (over time) select themselves,

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.360
step up, and want to support you in that program.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.020
And The Young Turks [show] is a positive example
in that their big political accomplishment,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.620
their big political achievement, is that they
spun off an anti-corruption program that's

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.810
called Wolf-PAC (Wolf P.A.C.).

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:34.520
And that's an anti-corruption political movement
to try to reform legislation that defines

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.220
how donations are accepted by politicians
in the United States.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.940
And that's a very specific issue, with a very
narrow constituency in the U.S.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.810
There's no way you could pitch a T.V. show
saying, "We're going to build a news program

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:54.020
that just appeals to people who are outraged
about political corruption".

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.400
There's no audience for that.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.180
There's no way you can say, "We're going to
be the internet news-show that talks about

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:07.940
the things that matter to people who want
financial reform in the American political

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.940
system."

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:15.530
That's a tiny audience, but what they did
is, they build a generally respectable, factual

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:22.290
show, engaged with all kinds of political
issues, and then within that broad audience

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:29.430
they built a hardcore political constituency
who will really support these efforts to reform

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.230
the American electoral system.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.030
And compared to anything else that's happened
in the last 25 years in American politics

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.330
they've been remarkably successful.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.330
No joke.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.070
If you want to look into it, you can.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:49.330
Okay, you may well say, T.Y.T. is a holotype,
it's a unique example and its uniqueness means

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.450
that it can't be reproduced.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:56.770
Well, I disagree because of my experience
in Asia, my experience with Asian politics,

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:03.340
and because of my experience with Buddhism,
Confucianism, and other Asian religions.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:09.310
Something for you to google is the New Tang
Dynasty network; they abbreviate that as N.T.D.,

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.650
"New Tang Dynasty".

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:20.270
That started off as a politically-persecuted
group of Buddhistsâ€¦ people involved with

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:27.200
traditional Chinese religion, probably not
best to say Buddhism in the narrow definition

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.389
of the idea of Buddhism.

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:35.510
They started their own news network, and they're
a religious movement that (in many ways) nobody

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.760
took seriously, and that nobody regarded as
politically credible.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.140
They built up political credibility for [themselves].

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:49.330
Basically their bias is that they support
democracy, and that they're, um, critical

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:54.710
of the current government of China (of mainland
China).

00:08:54.710 --> 00:09:02.710
They're not left wing, like a lot of Chinese
traditionalists they're into respecting your

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:10.430
grandparents and some other conservative values,
but conservative from a Chinese perspective.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.420
Very hard for a westerner to relate to that
in terms of left and right.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.440
Now, New Tang Dynasty, if you look up their
stuff, you can find them through Youtube,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.360
you can find short clips, but they are a broadcast
news-network, they do documentaries, they

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.570
do interviews with academics, they do all
kinds of things, and they broadcast over Satellite

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.250
TV around the world.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:35.000
In many ways they're much more successful
and professional-looking than The Young Turks,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.370
much more serious in tone, and they are not
a unique example.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:43.860
On the tiny island of Taiwan (Taiwan is a
small, crowded nation) there's actually a

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:51.560
long list of of TV news-programs, uh, news-networks,
channels, that are operated by different religious

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.180
groups and different dissident groups.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.460
Sometimes people who have run away from China,
sometimes groups that were always in Taiwan,

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.460
and so on.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.610
And, again, the interesting thing is, just
by talking in a transparent, down-to-earth

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:09.360
way about real-world events, all those groups
prove, again and again, you build up a constituency:

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.770
you make the connections with like-minded
people and those like-minded people may donate

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:20.730
money to your cause, it may be that like The
Young Turks you spin off a separate political

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.890
organization, or whatever it is.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:30.970
Yeah, so that was my honest answer to the
question of what can happen now to make the

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.450
situation with "digital veganism" better.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:42.310
Yes, you could have some kind of meaningful,
current-events talk-show (The Young Turks

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.290
calls itself a talk-show, we're not even talking
about original, primary-source journalism)

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:51.800
if you got five people or 10 people together
who could really co-operate, who all happen

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:58.000
to be vegan, and who wanted to put something
on Youtube that's really substantive, that

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.070
is not about buying expensive bicycles, that
is not about how good you look in a bikini,

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.880
that is engaged with real-world issues anywhere
in the world.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.970
Now, where it is in the world would change
your mandate and how you define it from day

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:13.970
1.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:19.080
If I were doing a project like that in Canada,
based in Ottawa, the capital city of Canada,

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.880
I would be looking at a service that would
talk a lot about First Nations issues, about

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.920
indigenous peoples' politics.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:31.120
Obviously, if you're in any specific country,
you're going to want to look at agriculture

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:39.270
in that country, deforestation, politics of
animal rights to some extent; you would define

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.550
the mandate, the issues that are in, and the
issues that are out.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.680
If it was a news-service that was based in
Chiang Mai, if you were putting together a

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.839
bunch of vegans to do original research and
original opinions [in reaction to] what's

00:11:50.839 --> 00:11:54.310
going on, how you define that would be up
in the air.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.410
You'd have to make some hard decisions and
you'd have to have people who come on really

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.250
discuss, "Look, what's on the table?

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:06.340
What are we going to report on, and what are
we not going to report on?"

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.150
And what I'm suggesting here is not a vegan
news show.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:16.930
Actually there's a Youtuber called Kerry McCarpet
and she, as one woman, alone, is currently

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.850
doing a vegan news show, where she just talks
about vegan issues that have popped up in

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:27.860
the mainstream media (so, recent controversies
with Beyonce deciding she's vegan, and these

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.150
kinds of things, things that happened in popular
newspapers).

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:38.470
That's not really what I'm talking about here,
although that's very praiseworthy in its way.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:45.880
Yeah, let me say this: some of the people
who have written to me (from Northern Thailand,

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.500
in response to my recent critique of what's
been going on there), some of them have said,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:56.070
in effect, "Look, what we're doing may be
shallow, and it may be vain, it may be all

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:05.610
about good-looking people in bikinis and expensive
bicycles, but we want to think of this as

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:13.720
an advertisement for veganism, that we're
showing beauty, luxury, a life of self-indulgence,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.580
and that that advertises veganism."

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:24.160
And my response to that is, "No, what you're
showing is a meaningless life, and you're

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.000
advertising veganism as the means to that
life."

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.720
And that plays into some shallow cult bullshit,
man.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:36.589
And a lot of people in this game, they can't
see the harm in it: they can't see the harm

00:13:36.589 --> 00:13:40.830
in getting on Youtube and promising you a
weight-loss miracle, in promising you that

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.650
you'll be more attractive, in promising you
that you'll make more money, that you'll be

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.500
happier, by being vegan.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.620
You'll have unearned riches, that you're going
to work a four-hour work-week, and you're

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:56.200
going to unlock your potential through the
power of positive thinking: that's not a slippery

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:02.220
slope to some cult bullshit, that already
is some cult bullshit.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.290
And that does not build a constituency.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:12.339
Selling diet books may be a wonderful business,
but it does not build a constituency in this

00:14:12.339 --> 00:14:13.339
way.

00:14:13.339 --> 00:14:18.360
What I'm talking about is the opposite, where
you're not celebrating the most meaningless,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:25.620
vain indulgences of the vegan lifestyle (right?),
and you're not promoting to people, "Hey,

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:31.720
if you become vegan, you too can live on permanent
vacation in Chiang Mai, you too can live a

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.670
life of constant self-indulgence and 'infinite
abundance'", and all this other stuff that

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.230
(on some level) everyone knows you can't deliver
on.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.640
You know, look, hey, this promised lifestyle
in Northern Thailand, you guys who are making

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.769
Youtube videos promoting this: if you really
believe in it, why are you preaching it to

00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:49.100
me?

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.910
Why are you preaching it to white people in
the Western world?

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.450
Why are you telling me to buy an airplane
ticket to go to Northern Thailand?

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.950
I've already been there and done that, I've
already been on a bicycle and gone more than

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.350
100 km at one time, I already know what that's
like.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.860
But I wasn't doing it for meaningless reasons.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.370
If you believed in that lifestyle, and if
you believed that people could have "abundance"

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:13.731
and a higher income, and the power of positive
thinking, why don't you preach that to the

00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:16.440
people who work at the fruit market?

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.519
To the peasants who are growing your food?

00:15:18.519 --> 00:15:23.921
Why don't you preach that, why don't you bring
that message, as a charity, to people who

00:15:23.921 --> 00:15:27.900
have crossed the border from Cambodia into
Thailand, from Myanmar into Thailand, who

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.530
are living in poverty there?

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:34.410
Why don't you set up an N.G.O. locally to
bring that message to the people who need

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:39.240
it, and to the people whom it would help,
if it worked?

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.500
Instead of trying to sell it to people who
already have money, who already have leisure?

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:50.110
White, wealthy, western people, who can buy
an airplane ticket, and pretend to dissimulate

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:55.500
the lifestyle you're selling as the payoff
for turning vegan; with a whole bunch of distractions,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:00.079
with a whole bunch of vain indulgences that
have nothing to do with the core issues of

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:10.450
compassion, ecology, ethics, you-name-it.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:14.310
Trying to stay positive.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:18.370
Real-world veganism is different from digital
veganism, and I accept that.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:24.050
And I'm not here to hate on people because
the illusion they present on Instagram is

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.860
not the same as their real life.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.920
Digital veganism is not the same as real-world
veganism.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.200
There are people here, in the city I live
in, in Canada, and their idea of vegan activism

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:40.520
is, y'know, literally, smashing cages, and
literally carrying out sabotage.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.620
And when I meet those people ('cause that's
real-world, that's not digital veganism),

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:49.959
when I meet those people, what I say to them
is, "Look, I've never met a vegan where I

00:16:49.959 --> 00:16:54.560
thought, 'the best thing you can do with your
future, to make a difference, is spending

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.810
a couple of years in jail', and that's what
you're doing [to yourself]."

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:03.620
I'm against that kind of activism partly because
I don't think it's a good use of your time

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.789
to go to jail, no matter what symbolic value
you may imagine committing crimes and going

00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:12.359
to jail [may have], that's bad advice.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:21.339
I don't advise any kind of violent or illegal
action or protest in real life.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:26.759
I also don't think that you should take the
back door into City Call when you haven't

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:29.299
tried the front door yet.

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:33.460
All these political issues, all these ethical
issues, all these concerns that are central

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:41.999
to veganism, you've got to try doing the legal,
ethical, public form of engagement, and only

00:17:41.999 --> 00:17:47.940
after you've exhausted that should you even
look at bending the rules.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.630
And in a country like Canada?

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.280
Have you ever taken a complaint to City Hall?

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.830
I have (a million years ago when I was living
in Toronto).

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:01.730
There are ways that we can engage in these
issues publicly and responsibly in terms of

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.440
real life vegan activism.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:12.110
Now, digital activism, has drifted so far
from that range of options and issues I've

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:17.909
just described: City Hall through to people
going out and trying to sabotage a mink farm

00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:21.559
(that's the way Gary Yourofsky got famous
in the first place, you know, he went to jail

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:28.100
because he sabotaged a mink farm; it's a crime).

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:34.019
That range of issues over here, the range
we're looking at on Youtube and Instagram

00:18:34.019 --> 00:18:39.240
and in digital veganism is so disconnected,
it's so far away.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.549
You know, why wouldn't one reflect the other?

00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:44.909
Even if critically?

00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:52.139
Even if your program on Youtube is asking
the question, "Look, should people really

00:18:52.139 --> 00:18:56.460
be putting themselves in jail to sabotage
a mink farm?"

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:03.409
Y'know, how can we allow veganism to drift
so far away from its core issues and become

00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:10.249
a celebration of, "Look at my new manicure",
"Don't I look hot in this new swimsuit?",

00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:17.309
"Here are me and my wealthy friends wasting
our money (or wasting our parents' money)

00:19:17.309 --> 00:19:23.090
to ride around on a Bianchi bicycle, that's
manufactured in Italy, while I'm in Southeast

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:30.429
Asia", editing out the poverty and the filth
and the struggle that's just out of the frame.

00:19:30.429 --> 00:19:39.730
Look, on a really fundamental level, I can
sympathize with all these people, okay.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:46.000
I think that veganism is such a fundamentally
important issue that there is almost no wrong

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.409
way to talk about it, that any discussion,
that any debate of this kind is making a positive

00:19:52.409 --> 00:19:59.090
contribution, that any noise about veganism
is better than the silence that we're all

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:00.500
struggling against.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:05.200
But when people have come to me with this
question, "How can we do better in 'digital

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.200
veganism'?

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.200
On Youtube, on the Net?"

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.340
"How can 'we' (this doesn't include me), how
can 'we' as a group of entrepreneurs and Youtube

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.419
personalities in Northern Thailand, in California,
scattered around the world, how can we do

00:20:16.419 --> 00:20:20.940
something better?", I would say, hey, look
at The Young Turks.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.109
Look at New Tang Dynasty.

00:20:23.109 --> 00:20:29.609
Look at examples of movements, political movements
and religious movements, that built up their

00:20:29.609 --> 00:20:38.259
own legitimacy and that built up a constituency,
not by glorifying themselves, not by making

00:20:38.259 --> 00:20:44.120
promises they can't deliver on, not by this
kind of snake-oil-salesman "positive thinking",

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:51.799
"visualization", "lose-weight", "make-money",
not by any of that cult bullshit, but by having

00:20:51.799 --> 00:20:58.419
a really sincere engagement with real-world
issues, through active research, informed

00:20:58.419 --> 00:21:06.179
opinion, debate, coming back and admitting
when you're wrong about something.

00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:08.879
Youtube would be a wonderful platform for
that.

00:21:08.879 --> 00:21:13.929
And there should be a vegan voice, there should
be a plurality of vegan voices, both on a

00:21:13.929 --> 00:21:21.129
global level and engaged with the reality
of particular places, like Chiang Mai, Thailand,

00:21:21.129 --> 00:21:22.700
like Ottawa, Canada.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:30.830
I've gotta say, we've got a lot of talented
people on Youtube, right now, talking about

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:31.830
veganism.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.299
We can talk about something a lot more meaningful
than bikinis and bicycles.

00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:38.139
We can make it happen.
