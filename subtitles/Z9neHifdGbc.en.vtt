00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.670
In the first thousand words you're likely
to learn in Chinese, you'll see the image

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.529
of meat again and again.

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.250
Not just meat, of course; you'll also see
bone, blood, fur, and all kinds of other images

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.230
that aren't vegan.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.220
What's surprising, and slightly amusing, is
how often these images have nothing to do

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.890
with the modern meaning of the words in question.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.029
The character on-screen will definitely be
one of the first thousand characters you learn

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.029
in the language.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.410
It has a very broad meaning, similar to the
English word "indicate", and its meaning changes

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.930
quite a bit in context, as you see with this
example.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.260
What is it a picture of?

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.410
Well, if you learned the modern meaning first,
you might be shocked to learn that it's supposed

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.030
to be an altar --and, specifically, an altar
for animal sacrifice, with blood running down

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.340
the sides.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.510
That may seem like a huge leap of interpretation
for a symbol that's only composed of five

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:03.390
lines, and (as you can see) the meaning isn't
entirely obvious from the seal-script, either.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.920
However, when you look into the history of
what the word formerly meant, and its links

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.170
to other characters, the explanation starts
to become easier to believe.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.630
The character on the right hand side here
is linked in meaning to religious ceremonies,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.250
and it depicts the same altar, but this time
with two extra symbols above it.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.740
The one on the top-left is the meat radical,
a symbol that you're about to see with several

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.210
variations.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.570
The symbol on the top-right is a human hand,
easier to recognize in the seal-script than

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.350
in the modern form.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:44.200
So, when we put the pieces together, we have
a hand offering meat over an altar --confirming

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.939
the theory that the basic symbol we're discussing
here isn't just a religious altar, but is

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.950
specifically an altar for animal sacrifice.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.299
In the middle of the screen here you see the
meat radical in its modern form with the ancient

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.310
seal-script on its right-hand side.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.450
You can see, clearly enough, that the complex
image of the meat above the altar does preserve

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.400
the same original pictograph, although it
now appears in various forms.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.400
Here you see one of the most common changes
in the way the meat radical is drawn: the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.430
picture of a bear on the left side of the
screen here does, in fact, have a piece of

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.910
meat in its mouth.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.300
I know that it's hard to believe that this
is an image of a bear, and it's even stranger

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.390
to think that the symbol for meat has now
become identical to the symbol used for the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.269
moon, but... the bear is, in fact, walking
around with a piece of meat in its mouth (although

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.050
it might be more poetic if the bear were carrying
the moon).

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.380
Just this one example will probably remind
you of the image of the moon in a number of

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.239
the most common characters in the language,
and if you now go back to take a second look

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.750
at them, you'll discover that they're in fact
depicting a piece of meat.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.290
As with most of the world's languages, the
verb "to have" is one of the most commonly

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.880
spoken words in Chinese, and the character
really does depict a hand holding meat.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.700
Some textbooks will actually lie to you and
encourage students to imagine that it's a

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.520
hand reaching out to touch the moon; as romantic
as that may seem, it isn't the real etymology

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.080
of the character.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.190
Here's another character that's probably going
to be on the list of the first 1,000 words

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.220
that you learn.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.299
Again, you're left to wonder if you're looking
at the moon, or if you're looking at a simplified

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.540
form of the meat radical.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.610
The clerical script, seen here, doesn't give
us too much of a hint.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.700
In the seal script, however, we can clearly
see that it is "meat" and not "the moon" on

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.790
the bottom half of the character.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.650
So, as you can now imagine, the whole language
is full of both visible and invisible meat.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.840
In some cases, we know the history of the
character clearly, and in some cases it's

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.660
a bit of a mystery.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.560
There are still debates about the character
on the left hand side of the screen now (and

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.880
of how this came to mean the color green),
but there's no debate about the character

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.630
in the middle of the screen: it does indeed
depict roasting dog-meat, although the modern

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.409
meaning has nothing to do with dogs, meat
or roasting.

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.239
Finally, the meat radical in the character
on the right hand side is especially annoying

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.270
for vegans, as that is the same "fu" sound
that is in the word "tofu", so when you're

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.270
looking at the ingredients for vegetarian
food, you're often stumbling over the meat

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.880
radical.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.720
There are enough Chinese vegans now that I
have seen attempts at spelling reform, to

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.480
get around this problem of meat ingredients
appearing in the written names of vegan food.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.831
I doubt that anyone has made an index of these
changes in how written words appear, but I've

00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:47.300
noticed a few examples on menus and store-front
signs so far.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.370
In this case, the reformed spelling of the
word removes the "egg" from the compound word

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.610
meaning "cake", however the second half of
the word still includes the image of roast

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.970
meat: specifically, you're looking at a lamb
or goat roasting over a fire on the right-hand

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.930
side of the character.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.509
Given the strange history of Chinese language
reform, you can ask yourself what's next:

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:17.350
so many characters were changed in the 20th
century (and sometimes for ideological reasons)

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.150
that it certainly isn't impossible that we'll
see the meat and blood disappear from a few

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:37.880
characters in the next hundred years.
