00:00:00.386 --> 00:00:05.888
For one thing, I'm not vegan to be vegan or to be part of a community.

00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:11.986
 In these 5 seconds, Unnatural Vegan mentions the other topic I usually do

00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:20.182
 I speak directly and pragmatically: the concept of community.

00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:24.663
 In the past, I have created various videos related to the theme

00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:27.505
 of vegans as a community, if we were ever a community, and if

00:00:27.505 --> 00:00:29.512
 will we ever manage to organize ourselves to become a community ..

00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:35.293
 Unnatural Vegan here claims not to be vegan out of a desire to belong to a community

00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:39.599
 it is not her goal, the subject does not interest her.

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:44.824
 Well, I disagree with what he says and this is not a criticism, but

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:50.529
 a point of disagreement which I believe is worth discussing; I am more ambitious.

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:54.245
 I am greedier, yes, I want a real community.

00:00:54.245 --> 00:01:01.591
 Let's take the example of MADD Mothers Against Drunk Driving (* association against drunk driving),

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:05.650
 they have at least one office in each of the 50 US states, they have more

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.935
 50 offices with staff always available. They have them, we don't.

00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:14.714
 In your opinion in 2016, which message is more important?

00:01:14.714 --> 00:01:17.183
 Drunk driving or veganism?

00:01:17.183 --> 00:01:18.465
 Veganism.

00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:22.652
 Although in the past, perhaps in the 1980s, there has been a discussion as to whether

00:01:22.652 --> 00:01:28.530
 MADD was an important lobby, today, veganism is a theme that

00:01:28.532 --> 00:01:32.696
 he absolutely needs to have 50 offices in the United States.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:38.821
 I lived through the time when gay groups have passed

00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:41.354
 from marginal on the rise, to very influential.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.173
 When I lived in Toronto, there were numerous gay offices,

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:53.577
 offices with gay rights employees, I remember there was one

00:01:53.577 --> 00:02:00.263
 specializing in lesbians, there were various offices with different political views

00:02:00.263 --> 00:02:04.111
 and in case of dispute, local newspapers would go to interview

00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:05.514
 these foundations.

00:02:05.514 --> 00:02:09.986
 They were political non-profit organizations, or whatever you want to call them

00:02:09.986 --> 00:02:17.260
 In case the police commissioner made a homophobic comment, the reporters

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.546
 they would go to interview these organizations.

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:22.266
 "Oh, let's go to that gay organization or that gay rights advocacy group

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:27.800
 to get an opinion on this affair. "This is a real community.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.774
 This was an important aspect of the city of Toronto in the past,

00:02:32.774 --> 00:02:36.995
 there was a real gay community, a gay neighborhood, gay buildings and offices,

00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:41.101
 they had lawyers, discos, they had their festivals,

00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:44.044
 all this in Toronto, I'm not talking about other cities.

00:02:44.044 --> 00:02:48.849
 There were numerous well-organized gay communities and journalists

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:49.620
 they had the opportunity to go to them.

00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:54.916
 Certainly our situation would be different if we were at the level of MADD,

00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:58.256
 or at the level of the Jewish community in British Columbia.

00:02:58.335 --> 00:03:01.680
 Jews represent a tiny minority in this part of Canada

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.616
 but they have created solid institutions, they have real organizations,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.968
 they offer scholarships and any kind of subsidy one might need in life,

00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:15.526
 and basically a person is free to go to them, to participate in a picnic and to discuss

00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:19.875
 face to face with other people about anything, such as a fundraiser or volunteering

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:25.153
 or any other idea that could make a difference in this world. I want all of this, I want a real community

00:03:26.511 --> 00:03:30.277
 and I find no reason to say otherwise or to say that this is not important

00:03:30.404 --> 00:03:34.531
 I certainly cannot expect veganism to be represented in a satisfactory way,

00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:39.212
 when the latter is represented as a diet or something that belongs to the private sphere without

00:03:39.212 --> 00:03:40.561
 political consequences.

00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:46.587
 I am a Jew by blood connection, but I define myself as a nihilistic atheist. Nonetheless,

00:03:46.587 --> 00:03:53.122
 for my life and that of my family, it would be more advantageous for me to claim

00:03:53.122 --> 00:03:58.999
 to be a religious Jew, so that you can participate in temple life

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:04.933
 because the Jewish religion here in Canada would offer me a community opportunity

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:08.533
 and everything it includes from picnics to retirement homes.

00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:14.715
 Yes, from picnics to schools to retirement homes, all the steps of life from birth to death,

00:04:14.715 --> 00:04:20.653
 the entire cycle of life can benefit from the support of the Jewish community,

00:04:20.653 --> 00:04:30.246
 or Mormon, or other kinds of crazy ideologies that are based on belief

00:04:30.246 --> 00:04:34.283
 in a god that does not exist, which are based on prayers that will never be heard

00:04:34.283 --> 00:04:41.154
 unless a person recites them on Youtube,

00:04:41.154 --> 00:04:44.466
 in that case the fans will be able to listen to them and that's okay.

00:04:46.154 --> 00:04:51.501
 When I look at communities like Mormons, I always think "I want all of this,

00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:52.844
 I want what these people have. "

00:04:52.844 --> 00:04:57.247
 For Mormons, it's a no-brainer to organize a picnic and group together

00:04:57.247 --> 00:04:58.893
 200 people, you know?

00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:02.685
 Nor is that enough, for Mormons it is a trivial matter

00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:06.219
 raise funds for orphans, or organize volunteers,

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.808
 create a project from scratch and be able to change the world.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:13.935
 I want it all, I want vegans to have it all, I care about all the steps in life

00:05:13.935 --> 00:05:18.557
 from birth until death, I have a 3 year old daughter who I don't see often

00:05:18.557 --> 00:05:23.778
 because he lives in Europe and I live in China, but nevertheless I worry and wonder

00:05:23.778 --> 00:05:27.687
 where will she go to kindergarten, where will she go to school?

00:05:27.687 --> 00:05:30.770
 Where will I go when I am retired, what a retirement home

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.953
 will my grandparents go?

00:05:31.953 --> 00:05:34.390
 From birth to death.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.362
 The question of gay rights activism changes with the passing of time.

00:05:39.362 --> 00:05:42.862
 In recent years, there have been some really tough battles for gay communities,

00:05:42.862 --> 00:05:46.363
 and nowadays they can be proud and congratulate that many of these battles

00:05:46.363 --> 00:05:48.299
 have been won.

00:05:48.299 --> 00:05:52.052
 in Canada? Of course yes. Obviously in Saudi Arabia things are different, there are many countries

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:55.974
 where the struggles for basic gay rights are still in their infancy,

00:05:55.974 --> 00:05:58.816
 but here in Canada no, we are one of the first countries to have established gay marriage,

00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:04.386
 there was a tough battle over legal issues regarding gay marriage and equal rights for gays and so on,

00:06:04.386 --> 00:06:08.104
 but these battles have basically been won.

00:06:08.104 --> 00:06:12.102
 The battles for veganism are still in their infancy.

00:06:12.102 --> 00:06:15.917
 Where is the office? Where is the vegan neighborhood, the vegan nightclub?

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:19.763
 Where is the nursing home, the kindergarten? I want all of that.

00:06:19.763 --> 00:06:25.639
 I am fundamentally more ambitious than Unnatural Vegan, I am not satisfied

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.044
 with what you people call "community", I am not satisfied with this group of

00:06:30.044 --> 00:06:35.855
 middle-aged hedonists, sitting in front of Facebook, giving each other "likes".

00:06:35.855 --> 00:06:40.605
 I am not satisfied with this group of teens on Instagram taking pictures of their asses

00:06:40.605 --> 00:06:44.985
 in a bathing suit and they say they want to change the world, none of this satisfies me.

00:06:44.985 --> 00:06:51.985
 Ok? I want more. Can I get it today? No. Can I have him next? No.

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:57.679
 Will I be able to see it before my life ends? Maybe.

00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:04.017
 MADD managed to settle down within a few years, what a percentage of American people

00:07:04.017 --> 00:07:09.490
 do you really care about MADD? A minority, a tiny minority

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.412
 of people who support a foundation that is incredibly successful.

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.922
 What percentage of people donate money to Jewish temples in Canada?

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:24.249
 I don't know, but a very small percentage. In the past I have talked about Sikhism in Canada

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:27.903
 representing a tiny religious minority

00:07:27.903 --> 00:07:34.623
 and as with homosexuals, they don't need to have separate restaurants since it's not a diet,

00:07:34.623 --> 00:07:39.781
 but therefore they have them! For example in Toronto there is a neighborhood with gods

00:07:39.781 --> 00:07:43.818
 gay restaurants, although there is no concept of gay food!

00:07:43.818 --> 00:07:48.813
 For vegans, however, there is a real reason to want to organize

00:07:48.813 --> 00:07:55.502
 and open a restaurant in a physical place, yes, I want all this, from birth to death,

00:07:55.502 --> 00:08:00.825
 from building temples to lawyers, to political organizations

00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:05.294
 up to the foundations recognized to such an extent that in case there is a dispute at the government level,

00:08:05.294 --> 00:08:09.076
 the newspapers know who to call, I wish there were several

00:08:09.076 --> 00:08:14.265
 foundations to call for a spokesperson for defending veganism in parliament,

00:08:14.265 --> 00:08:20.172
 in the newspapers, in the streets, yes I want all this and I recognize

00:08:20.172 --> 00:08:23.353
 that I don't have it now, and that we're going to have to work really hard

00:08:23.353 --> 00:08:27.663
 to get it.
