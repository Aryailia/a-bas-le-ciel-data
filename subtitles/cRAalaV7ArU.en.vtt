00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.620
First, I'm not vegan for the name, or to be

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.620
 community member.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.850
 In just 5 seconds, Unnatural Vegan touches on the topic on which

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.460
 I have spoken repeatedly in a sharp, realistic

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.810
 manner: community.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:21.749
 I have already made several videos in the past about what it means

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:27.529
 call vegans a community, have we ever been,

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.189
 can we organize and become one?

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.559
 Unnatural Vegan makes an interesting claim that she is a vegan

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:49.250
 not for the sake of the community, that it is not her goal, not her concern.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.989
 Well, I have a different opinion on this, and this is not criticism

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.739
 to her, this is what I am different, and what, in my opinion,

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:12.040
 worth talking about.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.040
 I'm more ambitious than she is.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.900
 Yes, my appetite is much greater.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.250
 I want a real community.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.460
 Look at the Mothers Against Drunk

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.460
 driving ".

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.780
 They have at least one office in every US state.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.040
 America has 50 states and more than 50 offices with employees who

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.520
 are constantly open.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.439
 They have it, but we don't.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.360
 What is the most important in 2016?

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.890
 "Mothers Against Drunk Driving" or Veganism?

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.030
 The answer is veganism.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.689
 Even if in the past, for example, in the 1980s, one could say

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.399
 that the Mothers Against Drunk Driving movement was

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:06.450
 more important, but veganism today is an idea that simply

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.530
 you must have 50 offices in America.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.620
 I remember how sex minority communities went through

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.390
 way from insignificant organizations and became very

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.780
 influential.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.010
 Where I lived in Toronto, there were several manned

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.360
 staff of offices dealing with the rights of sexual minorities.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.590
 I remember one of them was only for lesbians.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.879
 There were many offices for homosexuals with different

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:35.879
 political views.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.110
 And in the event of conflicts, journalists could contact

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.459
 to these organizations for comments.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.280
 These are non-profit, political organizations, call them what

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.280
 you know.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.569
 Let's say if the police commissioner does a homophobic

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.380
 statement, journalists know where to apply for an interview.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.000
 "Let's get in touch with this organization for rights

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.800
 minorities and ask them to comment on the situation. "

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.120
 Or something similar.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.890
 This is a real community.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.240
 This is one example that while in Toronto

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.239
 there was a real homosexual community, they had

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.590
 your area, your buildings, offices.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.349
 They had their own lawyers, nightclubs, festivals.

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.950
 I mean the gay community in Toronto

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.890
 not every city has it all.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.950
 There were many well-organized and active

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.590
 communities of sexual minorities, and journalists could contact them

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.590
 apply.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.239
 Everything would be different if we were on the level

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.730
 "Mothers against drunk driving" or at the level

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.230
 Jews in British Columbia

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.099
 minority in this part of Canada, but they have their

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.099
 physical institutions are real organizations.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.350
 Internships, scholarships and other types of social

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.480
 provision for people from birth to death.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.349
 Ultimately, you can go there for a picnic and talk

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.750
 face to face with people, and collect funds,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.750
 charitable activities.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.370
 Anything that can change the state of affairs.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.180
 Yes, I want it all, a real community.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.260
 And I see no point in pretending that I don't need it and that

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.610
 I wouldn't appreciate it.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.819
 I also see no point in pretending to be completely vegan.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.819
 satisfies if it's just a diet or just

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.060
 what I practice in my personal life and what will not bring

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.660
 no political fruit.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.980
 Jewish by birth, nihilistic by religion

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.980
 atheist.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.750
 And yet, my family and I personally would be much

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.490
 it is more profitable to pretend to be a religious Jew and

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.780
 start going to synagogue.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.620
 This is because here in Canada Judaism can give

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.940
 I have a real community, all I need is from

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.980
 picnics to nursing homes.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.760
 From picnics to private schools and nursing homes,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.490
 from birth to death, all the benefits of belonging

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.610
 to the community that Judaism, Mormonism and others provide

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.410
 crazy ideologies based on

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.410
 faith in a god who does not exist, in the reading of prayers,

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.410
 that will never be heard if only you

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.410
 don't pray on YouTube.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.960
 In this case, of course, your subscribers hear

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.170
 you ... and I don't see anything wrong with that.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.360
 I look at groups like Mormons and I think, "I'm everything

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.780
 want.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.510
 I want everything they already have. "

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.780
 It's easy for Mormons to have a picnic

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.680
 to which 200 people will come!

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.990
 For me, even that is not enough.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.960
 It costs Mormons nothing to organize a charity

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.510
 an action to help orphans, to establish a charitable organization,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.810
 launch any project and change the world.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.860
 This is what I want.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.970
 I want vegans to have it, I'm concerned about everything

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.430
 life cycle from birth to death.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.000
 I have a three year old daughter, I hardly see her,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.650
 she lives in Europe, I live in China.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.520
 And yet, where will my daughter go to school, to the children's

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.520
 garden?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.520
 Which nursing home will I go to myself, and where will they go

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.520
 my grandparents?

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.890
 From birth to death.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.150
 See The Issues Affected By Sex Minorities Are Changing

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.450
 with time.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.360
 In the recent past, the homosexual community has experienced

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.670
 many "battles".

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.580
 Now, this community can truly celebrate

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.940
 the fact that so many of these battles have been won.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.290
 It's in Canada!

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.450
 It is clear that Saudi Arabia is completely different

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.450
 business.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.410
 There are many countries where the fight for basic gay rights continues.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.190
 is in its early stages, don't get me wrong!

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.530
 But here in Canada we were among the first to legalize

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.530
 homosexual marriage.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.540
 There was a whole legal battle, equal rights for gays, etc.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.540
 These battles, in fact, have already been won.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.540
 The fight for veganism has just begun.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.540
 Where is the office?

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.540
 Where is this area, this nightclub?

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.540
 Where is this nursing home and kindergarten?

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.540
 I want it all.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.540
 I'm significantly more ambitious than Unnatural Vegan.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.540
 I'm not happy with what you call "community".

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.630
 A bunch of self-righteous average people aren't enough

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.590
 age, giving each other "likes" on Facebook.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.310
 I'm not satisfied with a bunch of teenagers on Instagram

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.510
 who take pictures of their asses in bikinis and still say

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.690
 that change the world.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.120
 None of this suits me.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.940
 I want more.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.490
 Do I have this opportunity today?

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.490
 No.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.490
 And next year?

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.490
 No.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.920
 Will I see it in my lifetime?

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.920
 May be.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.880
 Mothers Against Drunk Driving has grown

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.360
 in just a few years.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.280
 What percentage of people in America are really interested in

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.280
 activities of this organization?

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.280
 Minority.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.280
 This small number of people support this

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.280
 an incredibly successful organization.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.280
 What percentage of people actually donate money to Jewish

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.280
 temples in Canada?

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.880
 I don't know for sure, but this is a very small number of people.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.360
 I have already spoken about Sikhism in Canada.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.840
 These are all very small religious movements, and

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.830
 again, let's take homosexuals.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.800
 Homosexuality is not a diet, they have no need to discover

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.850
 separate restaurants but they do it!

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.020
 There is an area in Toronto where you can find a restaurant

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.480
 for homosexuals, although there is no such thing as

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.560
 food for gays.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.230
 Vegans already have a good reason to open

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.010
 a real restaurant with an address on the map.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:57.250
 Yes, I want everything from birth to death, from

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.280
 temples of bricks and cement to lawyers, political

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.280
 organizations.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.320
 I want to have an organization that is respected so much

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.010
 that in the event of controversy in the government, journalists

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.810
 will know where to turn.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.520
 Maybe there will be several such organizations where

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.240
 you can call who will defend interests

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.400
 veganism in parliament, in the media, on the streets.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.160
 I want it, and I must admit that I don't have it, real

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.160
 community.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.360
 We will have to work hard to achieve this.
