00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
simple but I think a lot of ways the
 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.490 align:start position:0%
simple but I think a lot of ways the
tone<00:00:29.490><c> is</c><00:00:29.699><c> improved</c><00:00:30.119><c> by</c><00:00:30.330><c> having</c><00:00:30.359><c> me</c><00:00:30.750><c> explain</c><00:00:31.410><c> it</c>

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
tone is improved by having me explain it
 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
tone is improved by having me explain it
to<00:00:31.529><c> someone</c><00:00:31.769><c> else</c>
