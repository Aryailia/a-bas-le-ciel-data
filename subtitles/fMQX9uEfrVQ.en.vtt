00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:16.230 align:start position:0%
issues um but yeah I mean I really think
that<00:30:13.410><c> image</c><00:30:14.410><c> of</c><00:30:14.740><c> somebody</c><00:30:15.370><c> working</c><00:30:15.910><c> on</c><00:30:16.090><c> their</c>

garden while their house is on fire I
 

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.790 align:start position:0%
garden while their house is on fire I
mean<00:30:19.120><c> it</c><00:30:19.330><c> can</c><00:30:19.420><c> be</c><00:30:19.510><c> implied</c><00:30:19.780><c> in</c><00:30:20.170><c> in</c><00:30:20.650><c> two</c>

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
mean it can be implied in in two
 

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.230 align:start position:0%
mean it can be implied in in two
different<00:30:20.950><c> ways</c><00:30:21.190><c> in</c><00:30:21.220><c> this</c><00:30:21.550><c> in</c><00:30:21.880><c> this</c><00:30:22.030><c> scenario</c>

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
different ways in this in this scenario
 

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
different ways in this in this scenario
so<00:30:22.570><c> like</c><00:30:22.750><c> I</c><00:30:22.930><c> mean</c><00:30:23.140><c> part</c><00:30:23.380><c> of</c><00:30:23.410><c> the</c><00:30:23.470><c> reason</c><00:30:23.530><c> why</c><00:30:23.970><c> my</c>

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:24.970 align:start position:0%
so like I mean part of the reason why my
