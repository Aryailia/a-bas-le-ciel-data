00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:14.430 align:start position:0%
that and say oh this was all an error
 

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:21.890 align:start position:0%
that and say oh this was all an error
you<00:19:14.850><c> know</c><00:19:15.770><c> so</c><00:19:16.770><c> I</c><00:19:16.800><c> just</c><00:19:17.100><c> say</c><00:19:20.300><c> that</c><00:19:21.300><c> was</c><00:19:21.510><c> a</c><00:19:21.540><c> sad</c>

you know so I just say that was a sad
 

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
you know so I just say that was a sad
and<00:19:22.170><c> sobering</c><00:19:22.380><c> thought</c><00:19:22.830><c> and</c><00:19:23.190><c> I</c><00:19:23.430><c> guess</c><00:19:23.670><c> that</c>

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:23.970 align:start position:0%
and sobering thought and I guess that
 

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.970 align:start position:0%
and sobering thought and I guess that
was<00:19:24.120><c> kind</c><00:19:24.180><c> of</c><00:19:24.360><c> the</c><00:19:24.450><c> last</c><00:19:24.630><c> tether</c><00:19:25.050><c> that</c><00:19:25.800><c> was</c>

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
was kind of the last tether that was
 

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
was kind of the last tether that was
