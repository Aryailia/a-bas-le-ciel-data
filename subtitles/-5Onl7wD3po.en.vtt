00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.620
Y'know, I think it's a shame that people talk
about ideology as if it were a dirty word.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.440
I think it's inevitable and really meaningful
and important that we talk about the social

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.310
and political dimensions of beliefs, and the
articulation of ideas in a way that's aspirational,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.000
in forming movements for social change, and
that is the realm of ideology. You can try

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.460
to change the nomenclature, but, inevitably,
we're going to talk about ideology. Some people

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.760
watching this will may not be old enough to
remember what it was like in the 1990s heyday

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.760
of phony cynicism that was referred to as
postmodernism, but there was a period of time

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.980
when people would say to you, straight to
your face, "Oh! How can you associate your

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.170
name with any ideology!?!"
"Any concept that ends with 'ism' is just

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.780
terrible and evil."
Anything that ends with "-ism", and y'know...

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.910
the shame is that some of my favorite things
in life end with "-ism".

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.910
But, y'know, uh, joking aside, it's a sad,
desperate state of affairs when people want

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.610
to pretend that, y'know, we're not talking
about ideology when we are.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.610
My feeling, coming out of the 1990s --because
I'm old enough to remember-- was that, y'know,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.540
political ideology had become the equivalent
of the disposable plastic bag. Everybody uses

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.540
them, but you've got to keep up the appearance
among the cognoscenti that you never use them.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.340
Y'know, like, when your friends come over,
you can't have disposable plastic bags in

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.230
view. If people are going to see you shopping,
you've got to have reusable bags with you.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.230
We're all in denial about the fact that modern
life involves plastic bags, right?

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.440
Great comparison, hunh? Where was I going
with this again? Right... ideology.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.340
Um, I sympathize with the debates I see going
on right now that are trying to expand atheism

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.340
from being a single-issue-cause to being an
ideology. And I don't mean "ideology" in a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.599
bad sense at all, I mean it in a value-neutral
sense. Um, a really good comparison would

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.499
be, in the 1980s --that I can't remember as
well [as the '90s]-- in the 1980s there were

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:33.359
all kinds of anti-nuclear movements that started
off as a single issue cause, [and they said],

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.219
"Okay, we're opposed to the nuclear bomb,
maybe [we're] opposed to nuclear power plants,

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:42.780
let's try to gather together the people who
have this one issue in common, and then expand

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.280
this into a meaningful social movement."
You try to have a picnic with a whole bunch

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.010
of people who are anti-nuclear, you find out
what you have in common, you find out what

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.319
you don't have in common, and, yeah, you get
into articulating the ideology: trying to

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.319
find common ground.
People become vegetarian, one of the first

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.930
experiences is the sense of disappointment
that you have nothing in common with the other

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.700
vegetarians you meet, because, as soon as
you become vegetarian, you know what your

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.209
own motives are, and then what you learn is:
other people have become vegetarian for different

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.959
motives, that are totally incompatible with
your set of motives, and that you may feel

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.189
very alienated from other vegetarians.
So, what's the line of reasoning, the line

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:29.359
of questioning that leads you to? It leads
you to question: what is the ideology of vegetarianism?

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.749
What are the ideologies, plural, that connect
people with vegetarianism?

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:39.760
And there's a similar questioning that naturally
goes on with atheism in the 21st century,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.060
partly because atheism has expanded as a discourse,
it has been successful, it has had best-selling

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.060
books, and popular voices advocating for it.
It has become a leading, notable part of public

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:57.079
discourse, which it wasn't 50 years ago, shall
we say.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:04.079
Um, so, where do we go from here?
It's interesting, and I sympathize with people

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.120
like T.J. ("The Amazing Atheist") and, uh...
Jaclyn Glenn, another Youtube vlogger on atheism,

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:20.269
who, both, within the same month, retreated
to a position of trying to very narrowly define atheism

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.599
and of pointing out that they themselves technically
identify as agnostic. You can see their discussion,

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.099
their videos, as to why they say that. I sympathize,
but I feel that they're moving in the wrong

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.800
direction, because the real challenge for
atheism is to move forward, and to say, no,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.310
this isn't just something that's challenging
one issue, one idea, one problem. This isn't

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.800
just about problematizing god. You want to
find the common ground with the other people

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.069
who show up at that picnic, and you want to
build something positive, and that inevitably

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.349
involves ideology.
To speak very quickly in what I hope is going

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:59.440
to be a short video, what is that ideology
in one word? I think that if we're honest

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.430
with ourselves, it's the ideology of nihilism.
Talk about words that people don't want to

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.639
use in a positive way, nihilism has a lot
of negative connotations, but what that really

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.860
would mean, in contrast to atheism (narrowly defined),
is that we're shifting the focus away from

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.490
negating theology, and we're engaging in a
broader questioning of the basis of belief

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.629
and the basis of values. And I think, inevitably,
that's where atheism has got to go.
