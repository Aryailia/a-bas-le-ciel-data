the point here declining public interest
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.260 align:start position:0%
the point here declining public interest

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 align:start position:0%
sound the alarm when you're looking at
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.590 align:start position:0%
sound the alarm when you're looking at
several<00:00:50.309><c> years</c><00:00:50.579><c> of</c><00:00:50.789><c> decline</c><00:00:51.120><c> in</c><00:00:51.149><c> interest</c>

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 align:start position:0%
that is and then you folded up further
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.910 align:start position:0%
that is and then you folded up further
so<00:02:13.050><c> okay</c><00:02:13.410><c> all</c><00:02:13.530><c> right</c>

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.590 align:start position:0%
channels so now we have that data also
so<00:02:56.489><c> yeah</c><00:02:56.670><c> when</c><00:02:56.880><c> you</c><00:02:56.970><c> when</c><00:02:57.300><c> you</c><00:02:57.390><c> add</c><00:02:57.570><c> that</c>

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
so yeah when you when you add that
 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.820 align:start position:0%
so yeah when you when you add that
together<00:02:59.480><c> it</c><00:03:00.480><c> backs</c><00:03:00.840><c> up</c><00:03:01.140><c> my</c><00:03:01.470><c> original</c>

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 align:start position:0%

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.070 align:start position:0%
together it backs up my original
