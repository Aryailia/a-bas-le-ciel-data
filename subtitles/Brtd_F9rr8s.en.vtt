00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
population maybe then you can bring
 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
population maybe then you can bring
about<00:02:17.400><c> some</c><00:02:17.760><c> of</c><00:02:17.850><c> those</c><00:02:17.910><c> changes</c><00:02:18.390><c> but</c><00:02:19.110><c> like</c>

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 align:start position:0%
about some of those changes but like
 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.900 align:start position:0%
about some of those changes but like
most<00:02:19.530><c> countries</c><00:02:20.010><c> in</c><00:02:20.130><c> the</c><00:02:20.220><c> world</c><00:02:20.340><c> were</c><00:02:20.610><c> nowhere</c>
