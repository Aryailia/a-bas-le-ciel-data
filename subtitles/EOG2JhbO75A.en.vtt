00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:22.420
We've just been through a long period of history,
since the end of World War Two, when Buddhism

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.750
was, in reality, collapsing in most of its
traditional homelands, but was perceived by

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.910
the West and presented to the West as being
in a period of renewal, revival, expansion

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.770
and growth.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.970
To put it into two words, you can call it
the "refugee period" of Buddhist modernity.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:56.829
Obviously, World War Two was followed by a
period of new nation-states being liberated

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.420
from the British Empire and the French Empire,
variously declaring independence and experimenting

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.000
with different forms of government.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.189
It was also the period of the massive expansion
of Communism, something that young people

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:17.440
today can very easily underestimate the depth
and breadth and importance of.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.010
Certainly [e.g.] if you were talking about
a young man growing up in Sri Lanka in the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:29.940
1960s, or [e.g.] growing up in Tibet in the
1960s, or almost anywhere in Asia, the big

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:38.210
issues hanging over the continent in the shadow
of the atom bomb that exploded at Hiroshima

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.510
were the competing claims to democracy offered
by Communists, Western Capitalists, and different

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.909
opportunistic ideologies in the new period
of promised independence, after the fall of

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.970
European empires, or the declared fall of
European empires, at the end of World War

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.160
Two.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:10.090
In that period, most dramatically and obviously
with Tibet and China, Buddhism was stamped

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.599
out of existence, but at the same time the
phenomenon of refugee Buddhism resulted in

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:24.999
a super-concentration of competing claims
to monastic authority in places like Hong

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:34.909
Kong, places like Taiwan, and, where they
managed to get a foothold, in America or Europe.

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.550
Of course many people were very eager to escape
to make any kind of a living and they were

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.969
eager to preserve any fragment of their tradition
that they could.

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.779
Of course, fragments that made money were
a lot more valuable than fragments that didn't.

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:56.209
So you got an unbelievable commercialization
of something like Tibetan tantric sex practices

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.639
that, within Tibet, 50 years earlier, only
a very small number of people even knew the

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.939
existence of.

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:10.579
Any kind of black-magic practice that people
would pay for suddenly became of great importance.

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.900
And, y'know, when you're talking about refugee
monks, literally homeless monks, often monks

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.909
who have witnessed their home temple being
torn to the ground, burnt down, books being

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.239
lit on fire and so on, that desperation, in
that period, was understandable, even if the

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.469
result was real corruption.

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:38.389
Taiwan existed as a world between worlds,
but many monks who were themselves World War

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:45.219
Two veterans, or at least had grown up with
the devastation of World War Two, and the

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:49.439
Sino-Japanese War, and the Korean War, and
ongoing wars in Asia, [they] had grown up

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.969
in extremely deprived circumstances with limited
education.

00:03:52.969 --> 00:04:03.299
In Taiwan, in that context, you had many monks
presented with the impossible task of reconciling

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:09.069
several different traditions of Buddhism,
several different lineages, under one roof

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.139
of one temple.

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:16.549
They were being presented with the task of
saying, "Okay, we're gonna incorporate a straight-up

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:25.110
Maitreya-worshiping tradition, some kind of
mixed Guanyin and Pure-Land tradition, and

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.610
some Zen lineage that had a completely different
set of religious practices, and that may or

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.840
may not have been linked to Japan until 5
minutes ago, they may or may not be in a hurry

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.560
to cleanse themselves of their connection
to the Japanese empire".

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.570
Instant reformation was needed.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.810
Instant top-down, hierarchical reform was
needed, with some kind of legitimacy that

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:00.340
would appeal to the public, to people who
paid for funeral rituals, and that would organize

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.430
the monks.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.310
With all that having been said in sympathy,
that's why it's very hard for modern, western

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:18.760
outsiders to appreciate the desperation and
intensity with which all of Asia discovered

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.950
the philosophy of Nagarjuna in the late 20th
century.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:32.890
I guess the mania for Nagarjuna really was
something like 1975 to 1990, very roughly.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:38.480
Why did Nagarjuna become so important?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:51.150
Well, suddenly, in places like Hong Kong and
Taiwan, Nagarjuna was a definition of legitimacy,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.320
in Buddhism and Buddhist Philosophy, that
allowed some traditional practices to be maintained,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.500
others to be toned down, neglected or rejected,
that allowed monks to stake their claim to

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.680
authority without having done a lot of reading
and that --to some extent-- also re-energized

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.740
the common ground between Chinese Buddhism
and Tibetan Buddhism.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:23.270
Keep in mind that Tibet's own reformations
had revolved around Nagarjuna and a commentary

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.590
on Nagarjuna by Chandrakirti.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:32.450
This sense that the philosophy of emptiness,
as it's called, was a central, defining element

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:39.630
of Buddhist philosophy, and that it was more
important than a long list of other principles,

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.810
that was something that had already proven
useful in the reformation of Tibetan Buddhism,

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:52.730
and so, in some ways, it's no surprise that,
in the midst of the 20th century's many crises

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.340
challenging monastic authority, Nagarjuna
was useful again.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:03.450
The other thing, of course, was that you had
a period when the high-level literacy in ancient

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.830
languages (including classical, literary Chinese)
was very limited and very scarce.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.370
There were very few people around who could
walk up to the wall of books that's referred

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.600
to as the Buddhist canon (or the ancient Chinese
literary tradition in general), who could

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.680
walk up to that, approach it, find what they
were looking for, and with confidence read

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.680
and interpret it.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:35.230
Now that is not to say that the world of [e.g.]
the 1890s was full of such highly-literate

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:41.510
scholars, but it's difficult to exaggerate
the kind of free-fall that traditional learning

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.960
was in, including the disappearance of traditional
forms of employment, for people who aspired

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.960
to become scholars.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:55.940
Of course that employment could include things
like letter-writing, simply providing scribal

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.720
services to people; throughout the Theravada
world of course there's a dramatic economic

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.100
and cultural change because there used to
be a whole class of people who were employed

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:11.480
in physically producing hand-made manuscripts,
and then when that class disappears, the opportunity

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.830
for anyone to really become a scholar disappears
(to a large extent) also.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:23.680
So this is partly a technological change,
along with the dramatic political changes

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:30.680
that follow after World War Two, and it's
partly a scramble to create a new orthodoxy

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.960
that could still be perceived as ancient.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.919
Of course, it's very convenient if that [new]
orthodoxy can be boiled down to one sentence

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:45.519
that everyone repeats again and again, namely
"Form is Emptiness, Emptiness is Form".

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:52.339
And that one sentence doesn't say anything
about monks refusing to touch money, it doesn't

00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:58.790
say anything about the long list of monastic
rules that are being broken on a daily basis

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:04.249
and that did (from an ancient perspective)
define legitimacy in monasticism.

00:09:04.249 --> 00:09:11.339
This isn't something I wanted to talk about
at length in this video but it's something

00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:20.259
I wanted to reflect on in terms of the current
crisis of Buddhist institutions across Asia.

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:28.620
The intensity of the period of "refugee Buddhism"
has now ended.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.370
What has it been replaced with?

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.579
Well, the attendant enthusiasm for Nagarjuna...

00:09:36.579 --> 00:09:46.029
I've met a few older people who still are
enthusiastic (in the truest sense of that

00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:50.110
term) about Nagarjuna solving all of the problems
in the religion, but they're fewer and fewer

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.059
in number.

00:09:53.059 --> 00:10:02.709
The hopes of Theravada scholars all failed,
and I could give a long video-monologue as

00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:04.800
to why and how that was.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:12.879
Here I would just note very briefly that the
very earliest period of success for the Pali

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:22.529
Text Society (the Pali Text Society, based
in England, one of the few published sources

00:10:22.529 --> 00:10:27.110
that made the most-ancient Buddhist philosophical
works available to the public); the earliest

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:33.339
period of their activity was not funded from
within England but was, in fact, dependent

00:10:33.339 --> 00:10:34.879
on donation from the King of Thailand.

00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:41.550
Thailand was then a very poor country of course,
and still today it's much poorer than European

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.620
countries.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:51.660
The interesting thing about the 21st century
is that this same pattern has continued, namely,

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:57.629
that the rich countries go begging to the
poor countries for the sources of patronage

00:10:57.629 --> 00:11:00.329
to pursue Buddhist studies.

00:11:00.329 --> 00:11:04.420
Anyone can look at that situation and see
that it's the wrong way around, and can't

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.540
possibly work very well.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:13.709
Still today, guys like Professor Richard Gombrich
go around trying to do fundraising, asking

00:11:13.709 --> 00:11:21.060
for donations from much poorer places in Asia,
asking them to give money to England, so that

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.029
there can be Buddhist studies at universities
in England, at a much greater price.

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:29.439
In terms of cost-efficiency and so on, it's
all the wrong way around.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:35.279
So that England can build on a somewhat non-existent
tradition of Buddhist scholarship.

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:39.170
And the reverse has not happened, or has not
been successful.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:46.490
We do not have a situation where people from
California with money are great patrons of

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:53.851
Buddhism in Asia; no, on the contrary, you
get a list of millionaires from Taiwan and

00:11:53.851 --> 00:11:59.579
Hong Kong who spend enormous amounts of money
to create Buddhist institutions in California.

00:11:59.579 --> 00:12:06.610
So that is now a tradition that has gone on
for more than a century, of money flowing

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:13.689
uphill, money going from Asia to Europe and
the West, and the results of what happens

00:12:13.689 --> 00:12:19.160
with that money, to say that the outcomes
are mediocre would really be an insult to

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.470
mediocrity.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:27.629
I've said before in my videos on Youtube that
I do not believe the future of Buddhism can

00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:29.509
rest on a lie.

00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:41.420
I don't think that we can premise any kind
of scholarly or religious Buddhist project

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.319
on misleading the public, whether that's…
[interrupted by noise].

00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:51.019
As you see, World War Two hasn't ended everywhere
in Asia yet, we still have fighter jets flying

00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:52.959
overhead here.

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:59.910
Anyway, with the two or three tropes I've
just mentioned, it's pretty clear that now,

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:05.999
in 2014, all of them have run their course,
and much of the Western world has also exhausted

00:13:05.999 --> 00:13:13.579
its own patience to waste money on academic
programs that, on the one hand have extremely

00:13:13.579 --> 00:13:18.809
little scholarly validity, and on the other
hand don't generate money of any kind for

00:13:18.809 --> 00:13:20.379
the universities hosting them.

00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:26.860
So, whatever optimism led so many universities
in the 1980s to create chairs of Buddhist

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.179
Studies --there was definitely a period when
it seemed that every university had to have

00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:35.939
at least one guy who could teach "intro to
Buddhism 101", or at least "intro to Asian

00:13:35.939 --> 00:13:37.959
Religions"-- that has largely disappeared.

00:13:37.959 --> 00:13:45.059
And, of course, gone, too, is any hope that
countries like India or Thailand would become

00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:55.489
great centers of new scholarship, religious
or secular.

00:13:55.489 --> 00:13:57.559
[Laughter.]

00:13:57.559 --> 00:14:02.209
Now I'm sitting here wondering if I could
put any kind of positive spin on the end of

00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:03.230
this video.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.239
[More laughter.]
