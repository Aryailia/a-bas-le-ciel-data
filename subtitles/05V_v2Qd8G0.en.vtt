00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.190
I remember hearing in an interview with
an ex evangelical Christian and he

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.719
talked about how the worst part of his
faith (as he formally had it as he was

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.420
raised in the church and up to a certain
age in his life... I think up to about middle age)

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.060
the worst part was the feeling that if
he did not preach to people they were

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.710
going to go to hell after they died.
That when he sat down next to a stranger

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.259
on an airplane he felt pressure, he felt
real pressure, to share the gospel with

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.920
them or to talk to them enough to figure
out, are they already Cristian, or where

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.629
are they at,

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.980
because from his perspective that
conversation could be the difference

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.660
between an eternity in hell and whatever.
This video is about veganism.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.760
In case you hadn't guessed.  There's a video up from a channel called
"vegan artichoke".  For most of you this will

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.390
be the first time you heard of this channel.
She gets fewer than a hundred views on

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.910
most of her videos. Just lately she's got
two videos that are of a more profound

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.439
character that I'm here appreciating. One is called "Veganism is

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.439
emotionally exhausting" (that's what I'm responding to).  Another one is titled, "Are

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.860
problematic vegans helping or hurting
the vegan movement?". So those are two videos I

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.130
recommend from her channel. A lot of
other videos are just talking about her

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.369
groceries or product product reviews
or what-have-you; that's of no interest to me but,

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:37.270
hey, some of you guys'll love it.  So, in her video, "veganism is emotionally exhausting", she

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.110
talks about the mixed feelings she has
about what she calls vegan activism in

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.030
dealing with questions from people who
are sometimes, hostile sometimes

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.140
demeaning, sometimes insincere, and
challenging her veganism. Also,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.130
interestingly, she talks about her
relations with other vegans and how

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.079
exhausting that is for her, and how she feels burned out, and what-have-you.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.890
So, it's worth listening to on the
whole.  It gives me

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.009
an impetus to here provide a bunch of
pragmatic advice that some of

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.180
you will find helpful and some of you
will find offensive.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.920
There's an earlier video on this channel
gonna give you the link to my own

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.459
earlier video that's called dealing with
disrespectful questions as if people ask

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.240
you questions posed questions are really
disrespectful to challenge you got a lot

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.070
of fan mail for the video I think that
you does contain helpful advice for all

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.950
of you including for this woman

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.430
artichoke however that video starts by
really tell you Who I am and why I

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.620
handle these situations in the way that
I do and then gives you examples of how

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.239
that works with young people viewed as
gives you a more general methodological

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:58.239
approach this here instead let's kind of
turnaround soviet art show I think the

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.880
most fundamental error she's making his
of thinking of all conversations as

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.920
activism a conversation is not activism
it's not and if you think of every

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.150
conversation you have his activism then
you're stuck in the trap of that

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.290
evangelical Christian who can't have a
casual conversation with the person

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.579
savings time on the airplane without
trying to save his soul right that's the

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.650
wrong approach activism is one thing

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.799
conversations human being is another you
do not have to testify you do not have

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.840
to present your faith you do not have to
justify your worldview in these

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.500
conversations of people as it is that's
a that may seem like a stupid point to

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.769
make but that's a really deep assumption
India obviously her attraction for both

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.769
social media are part of her frustration
so I don't know if you're taking every

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.360
year flippant remark on Facebook every
meal conversation as as as activism for

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.310
treating you that way of course you can
get burnt out second thing is there's a

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.480
difference between being sincere and
treating the other person's question as

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.740
sincere

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.500
the latter can really be a mistake you
know I said earlier video these people

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.739
are not asking for a one hour discourse
on animal rights not even if they say

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.150
they are as she complains there are ppl
challenger and they demand scientific

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.890
facts to back up everything she knows
these these organizations I've actually

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:35.250
had I actually see the people yeah
you're right what about huffing glue

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.640
what about getting high from sniffing
glue how do you know that's bad for you

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.680
can you prove it to me

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.640
scientifically can you in this
conversation right now walk me through

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.510
the etiology of how it is that getting
high from sniffing glue causes brain

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:04.190
damage I never look into it that much I
believe based on what I've read that I

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:14.000
know enough to make the decision not to
have clue how you if you want to you can

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.930
go to university library you can get
books off the shelf that will really

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.440
break down for you in detail
step-by-step biochemistry and you know

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.910
the whole history of the research how
this was discovered how the brain damage

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.820
from you can know that it's not
unknowable but I'm telling you I just

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.550
have enough information that I don't
sniff glue anyone in my life I care

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.600
about trying to get them to stop
sniffing glue I would never let my own

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.380
kids sniff glue yeah you know what I'm
I'm completely convinced that sniffing

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.600
glue is bad for you but no my dude I'm
not a neurosurgeon I'm not a

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.100
neurosurgeon another neuroscientist I'm
not gonna break down for you know why

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.630
and how sniffing glue destroys your
brain you know people who have these

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.700
justifications for eating meat the type
against diluting her video tape shows

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.610
you you can see them yeah you know what
you're right

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.400
you're right what about cocaine all the
justifications you've given for why you

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.669
can't give up eating meat

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.599
well you know the pleasure you get
eating meat do you really think that's

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:29.550
more or less than cocaine what what are
your reasons really for why you don't

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:36.280
use cocaine they can say whatever they
say he said you know what I don't think

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.039
that's the real reason I think the
reason why you do not want to do cocaine

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:46.550
is because you don't want to be a hit
you don't wanna be a crack it I think at

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.849
bottom the root of all this you want to
be a good person or you wanna think

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:56.490
you're so it was a good person doesn't
mean you regard someone is a terrible

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:03.919
person because they're using cocaine so
many famous artists singers rappers DMX

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:09.969
whatever so many famous people use
cocaine it's it's on the record but yeah

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:14.240
I'm on a really basic level of I have a
friend of mine of a co-worker at the

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.599
office and he uses cocaine I look at him
differently I think you'd look at me

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:24.139
differently I think even sure someone is
less trustworthy the less good they're

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:29.129
morally suspect you you would feel
differently about yourself if you work

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:37.020
ok so you don't do it because you want
to be a good person you know if you talk

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.589
to someone who cares but you little bit
their longtime friend family member or

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:47.539
co-worker you can also turn around and
use basically reverse Socratic method

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:51.589
and again you can see you know what
you're right now all your points you

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:55.969
don't whatever it is but the desert
island scientific reasoning evolution

00:07:55.969 --> 00:08:01.569
whatever the point is you you know what
you're right so why do you think it

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:07.520
matters so much to all the points you
raised your right you know me you know

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.409
that's why do you think what you missed
me know if they're not that close to you

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:16.080
they see something insulting back you
can look him straight in the face oh

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.080
yeah you know what I must be a god damn
fool is that what it is

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:32.339
is that why you think I do this you know
what's the point of those conversations

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.719
the point is not free to exhaust
yourself the point is not to give them

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:40.180
one hour lecture on animal rights

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:46.610
the point is not activism you know any
of these people have access to the same

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.100
source information you do now with the
internet more than ever you don't even

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.890
have to go to a library right if they
wanted to know

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:57.769
hard facts they wouldn't be asking you
these questions and like I would compare

00:08:57.769 --> 00:09:02.230
it to a me back when I was staying First
Nations that was working on creating a

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.200
JIP way these languages so indigenous
people of Canada what Americans call

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.519
american indians if somebody asked me
why are you studying for his nation's I

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:16.920
would not see them will you know this
happened in 1734 and then this event

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:27.779
happen in 1826 and you know article 12
of the RCA AP report says this that

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:33.430
level of factual analysis is irrelevant
to the question even if they're asking

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.529
for it you start playback this
conversation and again even if the

00:09:37.529 --> 00:09:42.190
challenges of this is all well you know
I read this study about 25 percent

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.779
difference in the rate of cancer
something to say you know what you're

00:09:45.779 --> 00:09:50.480
right you take it you know what hey I'm
so happy for you that you read some some

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:56.459
bullshit article needs now you tell me
why does it matter so much to me and I

00:09:56.459 --> 00:10:01.930
can tell you i think it matters to you
for the same reasons I think you have

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:07.240
chosen not to be a crackhead for
fundamentally some of the same reasons

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:13.029
why I don't eat dead pigs we have
something in common there there's some

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:18.970
be sick moral sensibility there that our
lives are not just about indulging in

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.360
pleasure and certain types of pleasures
changed the way we think about ourselves

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.640
that we feel about ourselves you know
you know what scientific information is

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.660
confusing I don't really understand
exactly why

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.810
offering glue causes brain damage you
know breathing insolvent I don't know

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.070
why I know all over the world people get
addicted to it

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:50.940
people turn up at hospitals that you
brain scans damn scary if my own kid got

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.200
addicted to it if my own brother if
somebody I knew if my co-worker at the

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.320
office

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:06.790
god damn that's terrifying just sniffing
glue but I am I'm not a neuroscientist

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:11.630
that's not my role in life is to know it
in that kind of detail that's not really

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:16.980
what we're dealing with here right what
is it that they wanna know what's the

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.130
fundamental issue question of your
motivations it's a question of who you

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.870
are and that's why can't I encourage you
to say you can invite them in a kind of

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.810
Socratic way you can challenge them to
answer the question why do you think it

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.670
matters why do you think I do it if all
these things you say are true what do

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.060
you what do you think the core of the
issue is and again I mean when I was

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.510
staying First Nations that that's the
real issue in table doesn't matter what

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:45.390
the person says you what they really
want it was what motivates me to do the

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.730
work and it was exhausting work of
having a text book open and memorizing

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:55.230
the numbers 1 through 10 and the names
of the months and the word for spoon and

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.870
the word fur Fox

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:03.650
word for wolf like vocabulary is almost
infinite in any language there are so

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:07.340
many hours to go into studying a
language like that apart from the

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.060
history and the politics and all this
stuff so what what motivates you what

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.920
would motivate me to study that why do I
care right

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.620
the answer is not gonna be this kind of
particular fact again

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.860
fundamentally you have to be open-minded
nothing open heart in two separate to

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:32.930
look when I'm talking to you not I'm not
trying to testify I'm not trying to

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:38.440
convert you I'm not like that
evangelical preacher this is not

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.940
activism this is you and me I'm just
gonna be real with you and ultimately

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.970
your questions are not really about

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:52.759
they were built meet there about Who Am
I what do I believe and why do I believe

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:59.220
it and i cant say that that is what I'm
an expert on not brain chemistry not

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.209
cancer not

00:13:01.209 --> 00:13:05.899
percentage of people get heart attacks
and not even from conditions I'm not the

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:10.509
world's greatest expert on Form
conditions I read some stuff and not my

00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:16.889
field of expertise as with the glue
having I feel I know enough to make the

00:13:16.889 --> 00:13:23.230
correct decision right but that's what
we're talking about Who Am I who are you

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:29.050
what motivates me to do what I do you
know really simple sense what you're

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.899
talking about is what is the meaning of
life what does it mean for you and need

00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:40.889
to label good in meaningful life now and
when you speak to that it doesn't matter

00:13:40.889 --> 00:13:41.829
how blunt

00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:47.370
leave you are when you speak to that you
will not get burnt out you will not get

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.680
emotionally exhausted you will not get
dragged into the types of conflicts that

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:58.959
vegan artichoke complains have been
making your life miserable so mean thats

00:13:58.959 --> 00:14:05.199
it that the secret to the whole riddle
ultimately is understanding the question

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:11.430
the real intent to the questioner and as
I like to say keeping it real
