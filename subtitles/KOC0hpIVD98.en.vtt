then when did you start to question the
the<00:15:16.459><c> basic</c><00:15:16.789><c> ideas</c><00:15:17.209><c> that</c><00:15:17.239><c> I</c><00:15:17.539><c> was</c><00:15:17.779><c> built</c><00:15:18.019><c> on</c><00:15:18.189><c> what</c>

00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:19.189 align:start position:0%
the basic ideas that I was built on what
 

00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:20.649 align:start position:0%
the basic ideas that I was built on what
I<00:15:19.219><c> mean</c><00:15:19.399><c> was</c><00:15:19.519><c> it</c><00:15:19.549><c> just</c><00:15:19.879><c> did</c><00:15:20.329><c> you</c><00:15:20.449><c> read</c>

00:15:20.649 --> 00:15:20.659 align:start position:0%
I mean was it just did you read
 

00:15:20.659 --> 00:15:23.529 align:start position:0%
I mean was it just did you read
something<00:15:20.989><c> or</c><00:15:21.409><c> did</c><00:15:21.529><c> you</c><00:15:21.619><c> just</c><00:15:22.299><c> think</c><00:15:23.299><c> about</c><00:15:23.359><c> it</c>

00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:23.539 align:start position:0%
something or did you just think about it
 

00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:26.649 align:start position:0%
something or did you just think about it
and<00:15:23.749><c> what</c><00:15:23.899><c> what</c><00:15:24.109><c> happened</c><00:15:24.469><c> like</c><00:15:25.399><c> I</c><00:15:25.549><c> always</c><00:15:26.359><c> was</c>

00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:26.659 align:start position:0%
and what what happened like I always was
 

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:30.309 align:start position:0%
and what what happened like I always was
aware<00:15:26.989><c> that</c><00:15:27.019><c> like</c><00:15:27.529><c> it</c><00:15:27.769><c> didn't</c><00:15:28.129><c> satisfy</c><00:15:28.399><c> me</c><00:15:29.319><c> and</c>

00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
aware that like it didn't satisfy me and
 

00:15:30.319 --> 00:15:34.059 align:start position:0%
aware that like it didn't satisfy me and
I<00:15:31.479><c> figured</c><00:15:32.479><c> out</c><00:15:32.719><c> it</c><00:15:32.899><c> was</c><00:15:33.049><c> like</c><00:15:33.259><c> too</c><00:15:33.619><c> long</c><00:15:33.829><c> fed</c>

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:34.069 align:start position:0%
I figured out it was like too long fed
 

00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
I figured out it was like too long fed
because<00:15:34.399><c> I</c><00:15:34.429><c> was</c><00:15:34.669><c> doing</c><00:15:35.919><c> 1995</c><00:15:36.919><c> five</c><00:15:37.159><c> four</c><00:15:37.549><c> most</c>

00:15:37.719 --> 00:15:37.729 align:start position:0%
because I was doing 1995 five four most
 

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:40.149 align:start position:0%
because I was doing 1995 five four most
of<00:15:37.879><c> the</c><00:15:37.970><c> time</c><00:15:38.179><c> and</c><00:15:38.659><c> I</c><00:15:38.779><c> think</c><00:15:39.049><c> it's</c><00:15:39.199><c> way</c><00:15:39.739><c> too</c><00:15:39.799><c> low</c>

00:15:40.149 --> 00:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
of the time and I think it's way too low
 

00:15:40.159 --> 00:15:44.589 align:start position:0%
of the time and I think it's way too low
especially<00:15:40.399><c> for</c><00:15:40.849><c> a</c><00:15:40.879><c> young</c><00:15:40.909><c> person</c><00:15:43.239><c> yeah</c><00:15:44.269><c> did</c>

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:58.970 align:start position:0%
the weight gain basically Morland all
 

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.339 align:start position:0%
the weight gain basically Morland all

00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959 align:start position:0%

important to me than my weight so I
 

00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:09.489 align:start position:0%
important to me than my weight so I
didn't<00:16:07.519><c> really</c><00:16:07.669><c> care</c><00:16:07.970><c> so</c><00:16:08.299><c> it</c><00:16:08.389><c> was</c><00:16:08.539><c> like</c><00:16:08.779><c> even</c>

00:16:09.489 --> 00:16:09.499 align:start position:0%
didn't really care so it was like even
 

00:16:09.499 --> 00:16:11.409 align:start position:0%
didn't really care so it was like even
