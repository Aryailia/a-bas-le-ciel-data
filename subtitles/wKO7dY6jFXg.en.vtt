00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.180
I'm trying to make this video a bit faster-paced
than the earlier ones in the series --so if

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.000
it's too fast for you, hit pause, watch it
twice, look at the subtitles, read the transcript,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.280
or do whatever you feel's necessary.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.890
The three characters you see at the top of
the screen look like they follow exactly the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.089
same pattern.

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:21.929
They don't.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.720
Your textbooks may have taught you that the
symbol they have in common (shown on the lower

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.980
half) is a picture of an intersection or a
crossroads.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.270
For the moment, I would file that advice under,
"kind of, sort of, maybe, sometimes".

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.649
Looking at our three examples on the top,
we can see that all three of them split this

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.890
symbol into two halves, to add a new glyph
in the middle.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.800
It looks like we've got a clear pattern here,
with the glyph added in the middle providing

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.780
the sound for the modern character, and the
image of the intersecting roads providing

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.719
a hint to the meaning.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.109
If you've heard the sound of the combined
character, tòng, it will always have been

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.220
in the two-syllable word hú-tòng, meaning
a small street, lane or alley.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.960
So, in this case, we've got the appealing
illusion that the Chinese language makes a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.610
lot of sense.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.119
The second example doesn't have the same phonetic
pattern, but still, on the whole, we can believe

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.610
we're looking at the same "rule", if there
is a rule; and, again, the meaning has to

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.330
do with streets, roads and so on.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.240
Given the pattern of the first two characters,
you may be inclined to convince yourself that

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.439
the third example conforms to the same standard,
especially if you're learning Chinese in a

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.740
classroom setting, and memorizing as many
words as possible before the next exam.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.110
Just like the first example, we've even got
the appealing symmetry of the glyph in the

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.289
center providing the phonetic value for the
combined character as a whole.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.680
Although the two characters look and even
sound as if they're examples of the same rule,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.770
they actually demonstrate two fundamentally
different patterns in how the language works,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.479
and in how we have to think about the Chinese
system of radicals.

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.070
With the example at the top we'd be entirely
correct to break the word down into its smallest

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.360
units; but the etymology for the example at
the bottom only makes sense in its combined

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.700
form, and, in fact, breaking it down into
smaller pieces makes less sense.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.891
The radical in the middle of the word wèi
is the "soft leather" radical, and the meaning

00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:26.470
of the word has nothing to do with soft leather.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.230
Many people would just stop you from thinking
any further about why the word is written

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.230
this way, telling you, "it's just phonetic,
don't worry about it".

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.760
Believe it or not, the so-called soft leather
radical is actually a picture of two feet

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.409
(pacing in opposite directions) on either
side of a box.

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.560
In the combined character, wèi, there are
two more feet added to the picture, for a

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.630
total of four.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.769
In this case, very clearly, the radical xíng
does not represent an intersection of roads,

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.150
but really does depict two human feet.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.250
Don't believe me?

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.080
Well, now you can see the ancient pictographs
on the left side of the screen, and the etymology

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.379
leaps out at you right away.

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.280
In this case, it's the combined character
as a whole that makes sense, not the individual

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.140
parts.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.489
If we think of the radicals as the atoms composing
the language, then the lesson to be learned

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.580
here is that some words can only be understood
as a molecule, gathering a few of those atoms

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.830
together at once (and, in fact, they stop
making sense when we break them down into

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.720
smaller pieces).

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.050
The four feet walking around the box are,
apparently, on patrol; so this pictograph

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.550
as a whole suggests the meanings "protection",
"defense", and so on.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.370
In this case, it's actually the smaller part,
at the top, that has its meaning only through

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.989
a phonetic coincidence: the glyph itself has
nothing to do with leather (whereas, in fact,

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.659
Chinese does have several other pictographs
that are directly related to leather and animal

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.700
hides).

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.659
I think it's fair to say that nobody could
have guessed this from the modern characters,

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.049
especially not in the comparative context
of so many glyphs that are assembled the other

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.640
way around, and that need to be understood
as atoms rather than molecules.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.300
However, we do get some corroboration from
a third character that sounds like wéi: as

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.660
is often the case with really ancient pictographs
in the language, a different version was preserved

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.940
as another word, so we can see here (at the
bottom of the screen) another meaning related

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.690
to the original image, this time with a wall
added around the outside.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.100
You can imagine that it would be misleading
to explain this third character as just being

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.320
"a square around the leather radical", and
it would be even worse to dismiss questions

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.140
about why it's written this way by telling
people, "Don't worry about it, it's just phonetic".

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.790
However, that is exactly what we end up doing
so often when we're rushing through Chinese

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.020
in the classroom context.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.720
So, what seemed like such an obvious pattern
wasn't a pattern at all, when we were looking

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.220
at how these characters were formed by combining
two parts into one.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.780
However, we have similar puzzles even when
we're looking at simple glyphs (consisting

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.230
of just one symbol).

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.500
If your teacher has told you anything about
the character dān, it was probably something

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.800
like, "It's just phonetic, don't worry about
it".

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.590
However, we can see right away that it is
an ancient pictograph that is trying to depict

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.430
something, even if we don't know what it might
be; and we can see from the more ancient form

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.870
(shown on the left here) that the two smaller
boxes at the top can't be separated from the

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.350
picture as a whole --even if we have no idea
what that symbol is supposed to resemble.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.210
If you try to break it down into smaller "atoms",
you'll get pieces that don't relate to the

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.680
meaning of the image at all.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.990
Richard Sears came up with a clever explanation
for this one (Sears is the guy who scanned

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.601
these images of ancient characters and put
them on the internet, and it seems that this

00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:00.650
explanation is one that he invented himself).

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.410
In the same way that we noticed, before, that
the soft-leather radical made more sense in

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.810
the context of a larger character, Sears looked
through the combinations of dān to try to

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.770
find a context that explained what the pictograph
originally was.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.350
His conclusion was that it depicts a cicada;
if he's correct, that doesn't mean that we

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.410
would be wrong to say the symbol is "just
phonetic" when it appears in other contexts,

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.340
but it lets us see what the context was that
the symbol was borrowed from.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.660
Overall, I think that this explanation is
a lot more plausible than any of the others

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.880
available, but if you wanted to challenge
it, you could basically go through the same

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.470
sort of experiment that led Richard Sears
to his conclusion.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.740
You can find the same symbol in other contexts,
you can contrast their meanings, and try to

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:51.150
sort out which one might give a hint as to
the first purpose the pictograph was put to.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.240
However, the most fundamental lesson here
is just that we can't always understand the

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.600
character better by breaking it down into
smaller and smaller pieces; sometimes, instead,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.550
we have to put the atoms together into molecules,
and figure out what relationships between

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.630
them might be.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:14.380
The Chinese language is ancient enough that
some false etymologies (following this same

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.640
pattern) have been written into the language,
and start to appear as facts.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.910
The symbol you see here is written as two
moons, side by side, and is part of the most

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.310
common word for friendship.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.920
Although it might be romantic to explain friendship
as two moons, side by side, the ancient Chinese

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.170
were interested in finding another, better
explanation for why the word is written this

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.170
way.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.590
So, at some stage, way back in antiquity,
they tried the same trick we just used in

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.620
suggesting that dān was originally a picture
of a cicada.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:50.620
In this case, instead, the idea was that the
two moons were originally two wings, in a

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.260
combined form with one of the symbols for
"bird" that you can see here on the right.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.840
This idea is still listed as valid in many
dictionaries, and some computer fonts try

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.500
to make both of these characters resemble
wings, in imitation of seal-script characters

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.340
that were influenced by the "two wings" theory.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:14.600
Unfortunately, as you can see here, the evidence
indicates that this just isn't true.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:20.670
The glyph didn't originally depict two moons,
but it certainly wasn't a pair of wings, either.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.920
If you're familiar with Chinese animal characters,
there was actually a hint that the two wings

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.500
theory must be wrong just in looking at the
combined bird character: the bird faces toward

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.480
the left, so it wouldn't make much sense for
the wings to be positioned in front of its

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.480
face.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.150
In this case, we can't guess the original
meaning of the character by looking at it

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.220
in combination, and we also can't figure it
out by breaking the modern symbol into smaller

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.870
parts.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:51.900
Neither moons nor wings, the most ancient
form of the symbol is depicting something

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.060
that we still can't guess at.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:00.860
So, our practical conclusions here run contrary
to the logic presumed by the system of radicals:

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.920
sometimes, the basic unit of meaning is not
the atom, but the molecule.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.960
Larger groups of symbols are sometimes the
only way to know what a single symbol means

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.650
in isolation.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:17.050
However, there is absolutely no pattern, rule
or system involved; we just have observations

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.970
to compare to other observations.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.340
Sometimes, the names and meanings of the radicals
are misleading, because the system of radicals

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:29.670
is much less ancient than the pictographs
they're used to define.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:36.460
Sometimes, what seems to be a phonetic pattern
is not phonetic at all; conversely, what sometimes

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:41.440
looks like a symbolic pattern, linking two
characters visually, may be arbitrary and

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.680
misleading.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.520
When your teachers tell you "don't worry about
it, it's just phonetic", you might find it

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.700
really rewarding to ignore their advice, and
take some time to look into the real etymologies

00:09:52.700 --> 00:10:05.149
of the characters, to discover there's a lot
more to know than just that.
