00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.650 align:start position:0%
take us away and so I think it's looking
at<00:04:12.730><c> the</c><00:04:12.820><c> front</c><00:04:13.060><c> like</c><00:04:13.209><c> I</c><00:04:13.239><c> think</c><00:04:13.330><c> that's</c><00:04:13.510><c> like</c>

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 align:start position:0%
at the front like I think that's like
 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.570 align:start position:0%
at the front like I think that's like
the<00:04:13.690><c> nosecone</c><00:04:13.959><c> of</c><00:04:14.470><c> the</c><00:04:14.530><c> airplane</c><00:04:14.920><c> and</c><00:04:15.070><c> the</c>
