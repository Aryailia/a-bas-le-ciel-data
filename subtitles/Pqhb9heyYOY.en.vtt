00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:08.820
Here are the two characters that mean, "butterfly".

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.209
Suppose I were to tell you that the second
character here is a symbol of an insect next

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:14.739
to a symbol of a leaf.

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:20.929
At first, that would seem easy to believe,
both in communicating the sense of "butterfly",

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.320
and in terms of the way other Chinese characters
are constructed.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.880
However, the modern meanings and etymologies
ascribed to characters make simple explanations

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.179
difficult to believe.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.640
I can almost guarantee that your teacher or
textbook told you that no, this was "just

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.390
phonetic", or said that it was a totally arbitrary
symbol, used to mean butterfly.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.340
Here, on the left side of the screen, you
can see a character that means "flower", and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.300
(if you recognize the tree radical) you can
see that it's a tree with an extra symbol

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.879
added at the top.

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.190
So, looking on the right-hand side of the
screen, it seems easy to believe that the

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.350
meaning "leaf" could be, similarly, a tree
with an extra symbol at the top, even if we

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.850
can't see the direct resemblance to a flower
in one case, nor a resemblance to a leaf in

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.850
the other.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.240
Of course, it already takes a lot of imagination
to see a tree when you're looking at the tree

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.370
radical.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.370
To digress on that point briefly, the first
thing you learn in studying the ancient characters

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.900
is to look for the resemblance of one character
to another, because the resemblance to the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.350
actual things depicted has almost always disappeared.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.650
In this example, we can see that one character
is a human arm, curving as it reaches downward,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.790
and the other is the basically the same image
inverted, curving as it reaches upward.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.190
There is barely any connection between the
pictograph and the modern meanings of these

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.240
two words, and there is definitely zero resemblance
between the ancient form and the modern writing-style.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.270
However, the two characters are still linked:
they still have a close resemblance, reflecting

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.850
the original logic of the language (even if
that logic is now unknown to us).

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.610
You may be disappointed to learn that the
ancient image of an arm is never used to actually

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.920
mean "arm".

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.129
So, while the numeral nine is a cryptic drawing
of an arm, the word that actually means arm

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.939
is an unrelated puzzle involving the meat
radical.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.280
Neither native speakers of the language nor
foreigners learn Chinese in this way: learning

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.939
the etymology and the relationship between
the components and their meanings.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.500
The Kangxi system of radicals can be much
more misleading than helpful, in encouraging

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.579
us to think of components in terms of the
categories that organize the dictionary.

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.659
This is one of the first words you're likely
to learn in Chinese, partly because it so

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.640
often appears on street-signs, in the names
of businesses, and so on.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.420
The modern meaning is similar to "an era (in
time)", sometimes suggesting a generation

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.459
of people, sometimes meaning the world as
a whole.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.459
If your teachers or textbooks told you anything
about the symbol, they probably claimed that

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.459
it was an elaboration of an ancient symbol
for the numeral 30.

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.799
Here's what that ancient numeral looks like,
in both the modern standard script, and in

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.810
seal-script.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.549
As Chinese characters go, it neither has any
resemblance to the modern character on the

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.859
left, nor does it resemble the seal-script.

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:22.870
Conversely, someone could easily say that
these two characters resemble each-other more

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.269
than either one resembles a picture of a leaf;
however, that's just as spurious as saying

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.790
that the symbol for a flower (shown before)
doesn't resemble a flower, or complaining

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.189
that the numeral 9 resembles an arm for no
good reason at all.

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.780
The theory that this character came from an
obsolete numeral created another problem in

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.989
compiling Chinese dictionaries: the numeral
30 isn't a radical, and is instead grouped

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.349
under the radical "ten", perhaps for lack
of a better alternative.

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.510
So we have this idea that the sense of "one
generation" could come from the numeral 30

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.799
(despite the lack of any graphical connection
between the characters) re-enforced by the

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.779
categories applied to the characters in the
dictionary.

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:10.999
Shì, the symbol on the left, has ended up
categorized under the numeral "one" --the

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.159
single brushstroke yī.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:18.239
Just looking at the characters, it would be
impossible to guess the radical was the horizontal

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.591
line in the middle of it; and, of course,
all of the connections between the component

00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:27.480
symbols and the character's meaning are difficult
to believe (whether we're talking about ten,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.120
thirty or one).

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.940
The Kangxi system of radicals is not perfect,
and doesn't pretend to have a category that

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.960
makes sense for every character.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.350
However, one idea, re-enforces the other:
people come to regard this symbol --in isolation--

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.630
as derived-from and linked to-numerals, and
then they read that meaning into the combined

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.630
characters.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.130
Here you see the exact same symbol with the
addition of the grass radical at the top,

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.120
and the modern meaning is, simply, "leaf".

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.880
So we have the same graphic symbol preserved,
and the same meaning preserved.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.980
This is the best and most obvious kind of
evidence you could hope for, and it isn't

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.820
hidden away in an obscure or obsolete character.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.010
So, regarded in isolation, this just corroborates
the link between the meaning of "leaf" and

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.870
the image as a whole; but, in fact, it also
corroborates the link between leaves and the

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.410
further meaning of "an era", or a generation
in time.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.850
Given that we've got a link that's both evident
in the ancient pictographs and corroborated

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.880
in the modern meaning of the words to some
extent, it should be easy for people to see

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.940
that shì here, really is a leaf, and that
the character for butterfly has a lot to do

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.520
with a leaf and an insect, and has nothing
to do with the numeral 30, and so on.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.300
However, there are two problems: one is that
this symbol has disappeared in mainland China,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.960
making it easy to forget, as modern simplification
assigned the sound and meaning to a totally

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.260
unrelated character.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.010
So, the connection between the characters
has become invisible.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:58.550
Secondly, people impose the meaning of the
component onto the character as a whole: even

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.820
the traditional character for "leaf" is now
explained as if it were an indirect inference

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.490
from the numeral 30.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.200
The sense of "leaf" is supposedly inferred
from the numerical sense of many generations

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.780
of a tree, instead of reading the pictograph
of a leaf as a hint at the meaning of an-era-in-time.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:22.681
So, as puzzles go, this one can be solved,
by looking at the characters (both ancient

00:06:22.681 --> 00:06:26.760
and modern), but the connections between the
characters are obfuscated by modern dictionaries,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.560
modern etymologies, and modern language-reforms.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.690
It makes sense that the the butterfly is an
insect associated with the leaf, and it makes

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.810
more sense for the changing leaves to be associated
with changing generations than it does for

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.690
us to get the same meaning out of an obscure
numeral.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.410
Now, admittedly, it is never enough with Chinese
to just say, "this makes sense", because all

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.250
kinds of things that are true don't make sense,
and things that makes sense aren't true.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.830
The connections we're looking at here have
become invisible in modern, simplified Chinese:

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:05.140
the character for the leaf was reformed, but
the character for the butterfly was not.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.280
In theory, simplified Chinese could have the
same arbitrary symbol for a leaf (replacing

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.860
the ancient symbol) in all characters, such
as this example meaning butterfly, but it

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.970
doesn't.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:23.130
Ancient Chinese already has so many amazing
inconsistencies that this sort of modern addition

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.770
to the confusion is... uh... not appreciated.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.750
Meanwhile, almost all of the explanations
you'll encounter have instead tried to argue

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.830
that the symbol is devolved from the numeral
thirty, along with the suggestion that thirty

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.920
years implied an era or a generation of mankind.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.110
That idea is not supported by the seal-script,
it's not supported by oracle bones, nor any

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.561
other evidence, but it is reflected in the
way the dictionaries are organized, and it

00:07:49.561 --> 00:07:53.300
has produced a lot of confusing explanations.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.450
In general, those will be the explanations
you receive (if any) from teachers and textbooks

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:02.000
--partly because those teachers and textbooks
have to cope with the dictionaries.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.640
While I don't think that shì has any link
to the numeral 30, I did present one contrasting

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.410
example in this video, showing that a modern
numeral can be derived from almost any symbol

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:19.590
imaginable: there is --currently-- no explanation
for why or how the image of an arm reaching

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:32.950
upward came to represent the numeral 9 in
the Chinese language.
