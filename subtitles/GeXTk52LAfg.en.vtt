00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.770
Suppose somebody were to tell you
that we had to reinterpret the Christian Bible

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.540
as follows:
you start with the premise that Jesus knew

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.910
what he was talking about
"therefore" Jesus could not have possibly

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.910
believed that the world was about to end
and he was having visions of (y'know) the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.110
destruction of the city of Jerusalem (etc.)
well, that wouldn't really entail a "reinterpretation"

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.949
of the Bible
that would entail a rewriting of it

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.199
or a censoring of it,
or that you just ask people to ignore things

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.080
that are written in the bible,
on the grounds that "Well, Jesus couldn't

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.080
be wrong..."

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.100
"So... anything that's wrong, you're just
going to have to close your eyes to."

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.210
Now, there's a lot of nonsense in Christianity
but that would be shockingly simplistic, or

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.630
just stupid,
and I don't think Christians really even do

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.630
that.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.630
(Sigh.)

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.780
Buddhism is definitely stuck at that stage
of the game.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.869
You do deal with Buddhists telling you, with
no sense of irony,

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.359
"Um, look, the Buddha was very wise..."
"...therefore, it's impossible that he believed

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.880
in ghosts."

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.740
Therefore, all of the material about ghosts,
in the ancient writings, we, basically, should

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.080
selectively ignore.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.390
Let me tell you, there's a lot of material
about ghosts.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.790
Ghosts were a major concern, in ancient India.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.790
(Sigh.)

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.740
Y'know, the last video I put up
that discussed just one issue, with Hercules

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.930
being contrasted to the Buddha,
some people will watch that and will know

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.070
right away what I'm talking about
because they've dealt with the problems that

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.480
are ongoing right now in the scholarship of
the religion

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.560
and other people will watch it and say, "Well,
what is this guy hinting at?"

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.800
Y'know I remember I got e-mail from someone
following up on an article I'd published

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.900
about issues surrounding the embryo and the
development of the fetus in the ancient writings,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.420
in the ancient Pali canon,
those texts show an ancient world-view, they're

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.120
written by human hands,
unlike Christians or Muslims, Buddhists don't

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.300
claim that their texts are from a divine source,
they're written down by human beings,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.540
and, uh, there's no reason for [Buddhists]
to believe that there's scientific accuracy

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.400
in these things,
[the texts] reflect what ancient people thought

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.140
about where babies come from [etc.].

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:16.060
Well, I remember I got an e-mail objecting
that, no, my interpretation of the text must

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.810
be wrong,
that it "logically" must be wrong,

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.240
because it doesn't meet up with the modern,
scientific notion of how pregnancy, gestation

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.400
and birth work.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.170
Y'know, to me, that mind-set is so laughable,
it's so sad, it's so pathetic,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.670
but for the people who are stuck in it, it's
invisible.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.410
They're so emotionally wrapped up in this
business of imposing modern expectations on

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.320
the text,
of thinking "this must live up to this expectation",

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.780
[thinking,] "the Buddha that I see in the
text must satisfy my need for this religion

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.580
to be rational, scientific..."
or to reflect some other virtue, or reflect

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.950
some particular form of mysticism that they
ascribe to [the text].

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.370
It's sad, and I've seen it at all levels of
education,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.660
I've seen it with, y'know, the village monk
who has only had a traditional education,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.759
and I remember, in particular, one woman with
a PhD

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:30.000
presenting some of her PhD research
[her thesis] dealt specifically with ethical

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.970
consequences of action, and life-and-death
(etc.).

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.930
She managed to go through the whole presentation
without mentioning hell,

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.030
and I started to ask a question,
I didn't finish my sentence, dealing with

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.800
hell, during the question period,
[and] she basically had a nervous breakdown

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.210
on stage.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.720
And, y'know, that's pathetic.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:05:01.180
The term "cognitive dissonance" is over-used,
but you're looking at people who are so brittle

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.560
in clinging to their notion of what the text
"must" be

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.280
of what it "logically" must mean despite the
only evidence we've got

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.470
which is what that text says.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:19.350
It would just be pathetic if there were people
around who claimed that

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.820
in ancient Greece "nobody" believed in hell
(Hades, as they called it),

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.110
[saying,] "No, no, no, you must re-interpret
these texts to reflect a modern, rational

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.139
view of the world."

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.160
I think that would be laughed at,
and, certainly, people would be regarded as

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.150
insane if they stood up in a formal, academic
setting, and presented those views,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:52.440
but, man, in 2014, the discourse about Buddhism
is absolutely stuck at that stage.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.980
People are expected to be taken very seriously,
when they sit down next to you at an academic

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.260
conference
and tell you that they are "interpreting"

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.210
a text on the assumption that the author was
omniscient

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.030
and "therefore" had a perfect memory of events
that happened 2,000 years earlier

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:20.070
and you're expected to sit there and take
it seriously when people tell you their supposedly

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.380
"scientific" and rational views of Buddhism
that, again, they're imposing onto the text.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.590
So, when we deal with problems of "interpretation"
in Buddhism,

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:37.930
(ancient or modern)
sadly, what we're talking about isn't interpretation

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940
at all.
