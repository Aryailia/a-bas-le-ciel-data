00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.110
Hi.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.660
This is a video about veganism and the problem
of leadership.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.499
If veganism were just a diet, it wouldn't
have leadership, and it wouldn't have problems

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:15.209
of leadership.

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:21.250
If veganism were just a diet, it wouldn't
be discredited by bad leadership.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.910
A recent example of the importance of leadership
(and if you don't know what I'm talking about,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.870
or you're watching this 10 years in the future,
don't worry, you don't have to know any of

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.550
the particular people I mention here to understand
the issues I'm going to be exploring in this

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:41.540
video)… a recent example was the (sort-of)
rise and fall of Gary Yourofsky.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.330
Gary Yourofsky was a guy who came to prominence
through videos he posted on the internet,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:55.360
he went on to provide interviews on television,
and his fame reflected the intense desire

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.380
among many vegans to have a leader.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:08.159
His leadership was, in effect, created by
pent-up followership.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.810
Now the recent problem has been that Gary
Yourofsky, although he was just a leader on

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.090
this issue (on the question of ethical veganism,
being vegan for ethical reasons, for ecological

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:27.130
reasons and so on), he managed to discredit
himself --to some extent-- by making insensitive

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.979
and vaguely racist-sounding comments about
Palestinians and other ethnic groups.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:40.010
Now, from his perspective, he's tried to clear
that up by reiterating that he's prejudiced

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.909
against all people equally, that he doesn't
have any particular prejudice against Palestinians,

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.890
but the fact that this is an issue at all
reflects the fundamental desire of vegans

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.910
to have leaders, and the expectation that
those leaders will be real, political leaders,

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:07.160
comparable to any politician leading a political
party, or, you could say, a religious leader.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:16.370
Why should Gary Yourofsky have a "correct"
or "sensitive" perspective on the Palestinian

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.790
civil war?

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.640
Well, I live in Canada: why would the leaders
of any of our political parties know anything

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.290
about the Palestinian civil war?

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.160
I think, honestly, most political leaders
in Canada know nothing (I think they're largely

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.910
completely ignorant of politics outside of
Canada), but there's an expectation of them

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.530
that they will consistently make sensitive,
accurate statements about Palestine and numerous

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.470
other conflicts around the world.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.240
Actually, given my background it is somewhat
hilarious to me [that] every so often somebody

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.330
from the Canadian government has to make a
statement about Myanmar (also known as Burma);

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.560
we have nobody in the government of Canada
who knows anything about Southeast Asia or

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.891
Myanmar in particular, so it is always embarrassing
when somebody has to step forward and make

00:03:03.891 --> 00:03:06.610
a statement of that kind.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.260
Arright, getting off topic.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.150
The problem of leadership is created by the
desires of the followership.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.599
Gary Yourofsky would be completely within
his rights to say, "Hey, I didn't ask for

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.599
this."

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.740
Hypothetically, if Gary Yourofsky was a bigot,
if Gary Yourofsky really held tremendously

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.450
offensive views about Palestinians, he would
be entitled to say, "Hey, [my] public message

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.909
is just about veganism and [I] shouldn't be
judged for [my] views on the Israel-Palestine

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.190
conflict."

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.569
He can say that, and, obviously, that will
narrow the significance of his leadership

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:51.910
tremendously; he'll become just a fringe leader
of a fringe diet of no greater significance.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.980
But the whole public interest in Gary Yourofsky,
the intensity of the yearning of vegans to

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.269
have a public figure speaking for them (clearly
and unambiguously), reflects a broader political

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.599
dynamic.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:15.400
Likewise, people like Durianrider and Freelee,
they're within their rights to say they didn't

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.009
ask to play a broader political role: they
sell books on how to lose weight, books on

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:27.449
how to have a healthy diet, they make videos
encouraging people to exercise, and they could

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.229
say for themselves [that] they're not the
leaders of a political party, they shouldn't

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:38.469
be held to a standard that requires them to
be politically-correct or well-informed on

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:45.129
any other issue (aside from veganism narrowly
defined as a diet).

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:51.289
But at the same time we all know that veganism
has aspirations "to change the world", "to

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.449
save the world", "to save the animals".

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:00.550
It has a political mandate that's much grander
than just a diet.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.759
And that includes, of course, ecological concerns.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:10.559
Now, why are these people (people like Gary
Yourofsky, Freelee, Durianrider), why are

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:16.860
they thrust into this strange leadership role
when they didn't ask for it?

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.659
I think one of the most important points to
recognize is the failure of other institutions

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:28.669
who could have (and should have) played that
leadership role for veganism.

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.499
I live in Canada.

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:39.819
I was involved in the Green Party of Canada
maybe starting in 1998/1999.

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:45.809
Imagine what a different world it would be
if an organization like the Green Party had

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:53.479
played a clear leadership role in veganism
starting in (let's say) 1995.

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:54.530
Things would be different.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.069
Things would be different for vegans in Canada,
things would be different for ecology in Canada,

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:04.289
and, although at the beginning (back in the
1990s) a lot of people would have said, "Oh

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:05.919
the Green Party is crazy!

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:12.169
They say everyone should have this vegan diet!",
reciprocal with that, the Green Party would

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:18.410
have built a constituency of really serious
vegans who really supported that party, really

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.559
cared about ecology and so on.

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:26.719
Now, instead, the Green Party of Canada (like
a lot of other Green Parties and ecological

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:34.270
movements around the world) has made bullshit
excuses and taken a half-way position and

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.419
so on.

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:42.810
So, they've neither had the benefits nor the
drawbacks of taking a clear stand on veganism

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.370
over a long period of time.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.900
Another comparison that's not limited to one
country is Greenpeace.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.479
Greenpeace is not the same as the Green Party,
but Greenpeace has a unique history linked

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:00.559
to Canada, several of the founding members
(the most important founders) were Canadian

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:02.770
and so on.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:09.499
The world would be a different place if Greenpeace
had been unambiguously committed to veganism

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:14.629
from an early date (from 1985, let's say,
instead of 1995).

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:21.679
Again, a lot of people who supported Greenpeace
would have felt challenged by that: people

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:26.469
who ate meat and cared about ecology would
have felt challenged back in the 1980s and

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:27.469
1990s.

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:32.569
"Oh, these ecologists, they don't just do
public stunts, hanging banners from a boat

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:36.830
and saying they want to save the environment,
they also say that everyone should stop drinking

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.279
milk and eating cheese."

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.669
"Oh, okay…"

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:45.889
That would have been challenging, but it would
also mean that today (in 2015) an organization

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:53.099
like Greenpeace would have spokespeople who
were more famous and influential amongst vegans

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:55.459
than Gary Yourofsky.

00:07:55.459 --> 00:08:02.129
It would mean that Greenpeace would have opinions
and publications and a news-service that mattered

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:08.250
more to vegans than videos put on the internet
by Gary Yourofsky, Durianrider, Freelee or

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.240
any other example you want to name.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.839
And they don't.

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.539
They failed.

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:18.270
Those organizations, organizations like Greenpeace,
had the opportunity (the greatest opportunity

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.169
in the world) to play that kind of leadership
role for veganism, and they either didn't

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:27.039
want it, or they botched it, and bungled it,
and they failed.

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:31.449
I would argue that People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals (P.E.T.A.), I would argue

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:33.510
that they're also a failure.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.740
Maybe that's a more complicated case-study
to get into, and…

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:44.190
I knew a guy who was employed by P.E.T.A.
for several years, so, just to keep this video

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.300
short I'm not going to speak on that now.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.120
Probably somebody who lives in the U.S., and
has years of experience with P.E.T.A., they

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.870
should make that video; it is not really my
story to tell.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:01.019
I met and spoke for a couple of hours with
one of the founders of Greenpeace, and, again,

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:05.889
Greenpeace, their presence in Canada is really
different from any other country, so…

00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:09.610
I feel a little bit better-informed and more
connected to that history.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:16.029
And, god, that guy I met, one of the founders
at Greenpeace, one of its leaders and most

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:21.420
influential voices for ecology in Canada,
in his whole life he never even tried to be

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.800
vegetarian, let alone vegan.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.301
[He] never stopped wearing leather shoes and
I don't think he quit smoking cigarettes or

00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:29.899
drinking alcohol either, not to my knowledge.

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:31.149
Ugh.

00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:32.399
Painful.

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:40.370
And, y'know, he was a lifelong preacher and
activist for ecology.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.560
So there's a missed opportunity there, and
the fact that one institution misses that

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:53.290
opportunity creates a kind of pent up followership
(a demand for leadership) that can latch on

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:59.350
to people like Gary Yourofsky, Freelee and
Durianrider, whether or not those people ever

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.810
wanted to take on such a leadership role.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.100
I could end the video there.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:14.860
Maybe I should end the video there, ten minutes
is long enough, huh?

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:28.529
I think the other warning I want to mention
here is just that success in one place will

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:36.790
prevent success in another: one opportunity
that creates an institution will take away

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.610
other opportunities.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:43.750
If you live in a country the size of Canada
and the leader of the Green Party happens

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:48.149
to be a fruitcake, just happens to be somebody
who is not very intelligent or who you disagree

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:52.279
with, you don't have the option of saying,
"Okay, I'm going to vote for that other Green

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:53.279
Party".

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:54.560
No, there's only one.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.220
Y'know there's only institution, I think,
globally, like Greenpeace.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.769
There's definitely only one institution in
Canada like Greenpeace.

00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:06.100
Although you can argue that --in theory--
there could be an infinite number of political

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.560
parties, there could be an infinite number
of those ecological charities, in reality

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.350
there's one Greenpeace, and that's the one
institution my grandmother used to donate

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.250
money to.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:22.839
There's a limited number of opportunities
for a limited number of people to get that

00:11:22.839 --> 00:11:24.629
kind of message out.

00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:28.660
And that's why people feel such a sense of
disappointment if a guy like Gary Yourofsky

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:34.330
comes into the limelight and then discredits
himself.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:40.300
I'm going to briefly mention my experience
connected to Buddhism in Canada.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.769
Y'know we had Buddhist institutions and it
just so happened that the people in charge

00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:52.300
of them were fruitcakes, were bad people,
were crazy or incompetent, or whatever you

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.829
want to say.

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:58.379
You can't turn around and say, "Oh well, there
are plenty of other opportunities!"

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:04.779
No, those failures (individual failures and
institutional failures), those did discredit

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:05.959
Buddhism in Canada.

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:11.019
Those had long-term consequences, and it is
deeply embarrassing, and then you've just

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:13.560
got to deal with the consequences and move
on.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:20.899
For me, personally, it is kind of hilarious
to talk about those examples, but I don't

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:25.930
know how interesting it would be to vegans
watching this video.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:32.550
We had one guy in Toronto who was at best
very eccentric, at worst insane; he did lie

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:39.029
to people, I wouldn't call him a scam-artist
or anything like that, but he was dishonest

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:45.269
in his practices; and he managed to set up
an institution right on the edge of the University

00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:53.680
of Toronto that was proclaiming itself as
a kind of academically valid Buddhist institution.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.519
So, not just religious, but allegedly doing
real research, and providing language classes

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:01.579
and other functions.

00:13:01.579 --> 00:13:04.709
Of course it sounds great on paper.

00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:11.069
If it is a failure, if it is a fraud, if people
donate money to it and then feel ripped off,

00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:16.649
if the guy in charge turns out to be wildly
eccentric, that has consequences.

00:13:16.649 --> 00:13:21.779
And, again, you can say in theory, "Oh, well,
you can have ten different institutions like

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:22.779
this!

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:24.379
Anyone can start up a new charity tomorrow
and do it!"

00:13:24.379 --> 00:13:28.790
Yeah, anyone can start up another Greenpeace,
anyone can start up another Green Party.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:35.860
It's not true and, on the contrary, you've
got to deal with the long shadow of that institutional

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.050
failure.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:41.610
Within universities if just one professor
is crazy and discredits his department, or

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:47.230
discredits his discipline, it has a long shadow,
you know.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:52.730
So these are the dangers of thrusting people
into a position of leadership.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:14:01.279
And, look, okay, I see this happen again and
again: a certain type of personality is drawn

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:02.279
to the limelight.

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:05.689
I was involved in the theater when I was a
teenager, when I was better-looking than I

00:14:05.689 --> 00:14:09.449
am now, and when I was stupider than I am
now, let me just say.

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:14.600
And, y'know, back then, everyone knew that
a certain type of personality was drawn to

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.181
be on stage and was motivated to stick with
it.

00:14:17.181 --> 00:14:22.279
It is one thing to just do stand-up comedy
for a couple of weekends or once-in-a-while,

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:25.649
but it is another thing to be motivated to
go back again and again.

00:14:25.649 --> 00:14:31.680
A certain type of personality has the self-confidence
and the self-discipline to get up on stage

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:39.830
and perform, but at the same time has the
vulnerability to really want the approval

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:46.040
of the crowd, to need the cheering of the
crowd, or the applause, or the laughter.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.399
To really be gratified by that [takes] a certain
type of personality.

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:54.990
And very often people who are stand-up comedians
[and] successful actors, people who have that

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:59.819
combination [of traits], very often they're
involved with drugs, just as a psychological

00:14:59.819 --> 00:15:03.550
type, just as a pattern.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:07.100
Many people have remarked on this; this is
not something new that has just come out of

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.380
nowhere in this video.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:17.839
Durianrider, by his own words, a former long-time
drug user; he hasn't called himself a drug

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:22.749
addict, but he's said that he used every type
of drug under the sun, he's used every drug

00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:27.029
that's out there, he's remarked that he's
been in-and-out of prison, somehow related

00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:28.129
to his drugs.

00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:30.010
I don't know his criminal charges.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.139
I appreciate his honesty: it's great, and
it's wonderful that he turned his life around.

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:38.290
It's wonderful that he went from being a drug
user and ex-convict to being a vegan and a

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:39.550
fitness guru.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.449
I'm happy for him.

00:15:42.449 --> 00:15:48.939
Freelee, in this kind of vegan leadership
role, when she started out her main act was

00:15:48.939 --> 00:15:53.730
to say to the audience really honestly that
she was a former drug addict, she would refer

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:59.149
to herself as a drug addict, having this long
history with drug use that included cocaine

00:15:59.149 --> 00:16:03.610
but also a lot of marijuana, ecstasy and this
kind of thing.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.629
I appreciate her honesty and it is wonderful
that she turned her life around.

00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:09.990
That's great.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:17.440
And both of those guys, they have that personality:
they have a certain kind of reckless self-confidence,

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.110
but at the same time there's this terrible
vulnerability, where they need your approval

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:27.190
and you can see it gets to them, it hurts
them so much, certain types of rejection,

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.770
or people disagreeing with them or questioning
them.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:34.070
It's like a lot of actors, a lot of stand-up
comics.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:41.540
I'm not faulting them, but they're put into
a leadership role that (in some ways) they

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.730
didn't ask for, y'know.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.440
They're just out there selling diet books
and encouraging you to get on your bicycle

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:55.959
and, y'know, like Gary Yourofsky, what if
they happen to make some politically-incorrect

00:16:55.959 --> 00:16:59.720
statement, some offensive statement, about
aboriginal people, about indigenous people

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.899
in Australia for example?

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:02.559
Would it matter?

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:10.490
It would because our expectations of them,
in this leadership role, really are closer

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:16.120
to a political leader or a religious leader
than they are just somebody promoting a diet.

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:20.010
They're promoting an ecological cause.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.630
They're asking you to save the world.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.799
They're promoting a moral and ethical cause.

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:26.350
They're asking you to reduce animal suffering.

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:30.460
Those things go way beyond just being a diet
and fitness guru, even though they may have

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.440
never asked for that kind of responsibility.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:38.980
And I see the same pattern repeating itself:
who chooses themselves for this role, who

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.049
puts themselves on stage, who takes on that
kind of leadership.

00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:44.559
There's a new guy called The Vegan Cheetah.

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:51.649
I totally appreciate his honesty: he's a former
drug addict, former convict, and he did talk

00:17:51.649 --> 00:17:53.831
about the charges.

00:17:53.831 --> 00:18:00.299
He committed non-trivial crimes and he's been
in and out of halfway houses and so on.

00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:06.800
So, former drug-addict, criminal charges,
he's now turned his life around, he's become

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.960
vegan, he's become very serious about weight-lifting,
he shows off his body, that's great.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:17.320
If he were my own brother, or if he were a
friend of mine from high-school, who had that

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:24.090
kind of background (ex-convict, former drug
habit, etc.), I would be so happy for him,

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.620
that he turned his life around.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:31.480
But this guy could never get elected as a
small town mayor, because those questions

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:36.000
are always there: what have you done with
your life, and what haven't you done with

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
your life?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.100
To mention one more example there's a guy
who started a channel called The Glucose Network,

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.160
and he just dropped out of university, he
says it's his fifth time, y'know.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.980
And, look, man, he brags about it, with a
certain kind of bravado (his name's Abdullah,

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:57.299
dropped out of university for his fifth time,
and he wants to be macho and act like it's

00:18:57.299 --> 00:19:01.240
not a failure), man, my heart breaks for you.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:07.700
You can't get a B.A. and your parents have
obviously paid money repeatedly to put you

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:13.990
into university, man, I feel bad for you.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.890
And those questions are going to haunt you
for the rest of your life.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:22.850
I just use a small-town mayor as an example
but, obviously, for people like Harley and

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:27.760
Freelee, the questions are always going to
surround them: okay, so this is your background,

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.140
you used to have an eating disorder, you used
to be a drug addict, you used to be a convict,

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:36.870
but now, now that you have some money, you
have a public profile, you're selling diet

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:46.809
books, now why don't you go back to university
and get a diploma as a nutritionist?

00:19:46.809 --> 00:19:52.200
If you're running for a small-town major,
people ask about what you did with your life,

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.100
and what you didn't do with your life.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.700
You don't need a PhD, you don't even need
a B.A., y'know.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:05.940
If you've just been running, like, a corner
store, in a town, if you've just been an honest

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.980
businessman running a small business, you
can run for mayor.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.169
But you've got to be able to stand up there
with pride and give an account of what you

00:20:14.169 --> 00:20:19.830
did with your life, of what matters to you,
to take on that leadership role.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:26.030
Naturally, what's going on now in veganism,
because of the failure of institutions like

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:30.010
the Green Party (no matter what country you're
in, the Green Party in Germany, the Green

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:35.279
Party in Canada, the United States, wherever
we're talking about), the process we've got

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:40.830
going on is much more like people stepping
forward to become stand-up comedians and then

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.809
a followership latches on to them, expecting
so much more.

00:20:44.809 --> 00:20:48.010
And they may not have asked for those expectations.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.389
And the parts don't quite fit.
