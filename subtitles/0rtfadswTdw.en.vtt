00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.850
The era of the great famine and the great
leap forward is roughly 50 years behind us,

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.099
but we're now in a period of rapidly proliferating
publications and new research on the subject.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.180
This video doesn't require any prior knowledge
of the history of China, and will very rapidly

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.520
introduce you to the basic facts of what this
buzzword means (when we talk about "China's

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.962
Great Famine"), and how we know about it,
with an overview of the emerging literature.

00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:26.099
The quickest way to introduce the subject
is to look at a specific example, in a specific

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.609
part of China, and to then expand to the larger
scale of the nation as a whole.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.860
Xinyang is the name of both a prefecture and
a small city in Henan province: it is not

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.460
especially large, and it is not especially
important, but it is especially well-researched,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.550
and was one of the first examples of the famine
to have good archival evidence available in

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.070
both Chinese and English.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.820
In Xinyang alone more than one million people
died in the great famine, about one eighth

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.730
of the prefecture's population; in this case,
the Chinese government's own sources affirm

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.489
the estimates offered by outside researchers,
with very little variation between the estimates.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.110
Here's an example from a specific commune
within the same prefecture, quoting archival

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.080
documents produced by the government: "The
original population of the commune was 36,691

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.200
and from Sept. 1959 to June 1960, 12,134 of
them died […]."

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.940
"[For example,] Jiāng Wān village [姜湾]
had a population of 45 persons, of whom 44

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.810
died, leaving only a sixty year old woman
who went mad."

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.300
"[The commune had] a total of 1,510 [Communist
Party] cadres…"

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.060
"628 [of them], or 45.1%, took part in beatings.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.520
The number [of people] beaten totaled 3,528
(among them 231 cadres), with 558 dying while

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:04.010
being beaten, 636 dying subsequently, 141
left permanently disabled, 14 driven to commit

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.810
suicide, and 43 driven away."

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.260
So, in the case of this specific commune,
a staff of only 1,510 people were responsible

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.640
for more than 12,000 deaths, in less than
one year's time.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.280
If the geography is a little bit confusing,
I'll just note that Guangshan is a long bicycle-ride

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.090
down the road from Xinyang city, and they're
both in the same prefecture, within Henan

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.660
province.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.010
When people say that this was a "man-made
famine" (and not a natural disaster), what

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.690
do they mean?

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.230
Well, thousands of pages of new publications
have discussed and documented the issue, but

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.120
to give a really quick answer, I'll continue
with the same example of Xinyang prefecture.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.450
"Yu Dehong says that during the famine, Xinyang
had more than 500 million kilos of grain stored

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:01.540
in silos; added to that year's harvest of
1.45 billion kilos, some 2 billion kilos were

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.700
available.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.390
If the reserve grain had been distributed,
no one would have starved.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.700
[…]"
"The starving people saw storage silos full

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.220
of grain, but no one attempted to steal it.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.819
People sat alongside storage depots waiting
for the government to release grain and crying

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.520
out, "Communist Party, Chairman Mao, save
us!"

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.489
Some people starved to death sitting next
to the grain depots."

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.940
What was the pattern of coercion and violence
that created this catastrope of mass starvation

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.290
throughout China?

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.879
We'll now look at an even smaller scale, a
specific production unit within the same county,

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.750
within the same prefecture.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.220
"Although the communal dining hall was closed
due to lack of food, the production team leader

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.000
still stipulated "three major rules": no fires
should be lit in the homes of commune members,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.670
no wild herbs should be gathered, and no one
should leave the commune to escape starvation.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.690
[…]"
"Of the brigade's 25 [Communist] party members,

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.100
21 took part in beatings…"

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:15.030
"Out of an original population of 1,496 people,
555 died—490 by starvation, 55 by beatings,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.530
and 10 by suicide.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.490
Another 438 were severely beaten."

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.479
In this case, just 25 people were responsible
for 555 deaths, in the space of less than

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:30.789
one year.

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.479
So, as you can now imagine, the rediscovery
of this chapter of history has relied in large

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.309
part on the Chinese government's own records
of what happened, exhumed from archives, and

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:41.319
not just eye-witness accounts to the events.

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.270
In some cases, of course, all of the eye-witnesses
are dead.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.080
Just working with this one example, you can
also imagine how the body-counts add up to

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.720
totals in the tens of millions.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.139
We've just seen how 555 deaths in one work-unit
contributed to more than 12,000 deaths in

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.199
the county; and this county contributed to
the total of more than one million deaths

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.970
in the prefecture.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.629
When researchers add up the totals from all
of the prefectures, and work with demographic

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:12.320
data to fill in the blanks, they come to estimates
with a minimum of 30 million deaths, with

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.139
Frank Dikötter supporting a higher total
of 45 million.

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.819
Although we've just taken a glance at this
chapter of history at a small scale, the carnage

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.180
unfolded on a tremendously large scale.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.470
And yet, if you look around, there is remarkably
little photographic evidence available, and

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.789
many articles and books make use of unrelated
images from unrelated famines, to try to provide

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.509
some illustration for these events.

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:41.029
The photos you've just seen are from 1946:
although they show starving people in China,

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:45.919
they're from the wrong place at the wrong
time (they should be treated as spurious).

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.770
In 2013, Frank Dikötter reflected that, "…despite
months of patient work sifting through mountains

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.919
of yellowing folders, I never came across
a single photograph of the catastrophe in

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.430
those archives.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.830
Historians in Beijing explained away the lack
of photographic evidence by telling me that

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.360
party cadres at the time did not have any
cameras, as China was still a poor country.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.699
It's not a convincing explanation: The archives
are replete with criminal investigations that

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.879
contain exhaustive photographic evidence from
the 1950s and 1960s -- mug shots of criminals,

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:20.699
photos of crime scenes, even rolls of film
documenting land disputes between collective

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:21.740
farms."

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.509
"Certainly the state propaganda machine never
lacked for photographic equipment.

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:29.110
[…]"
"So what happened to the visual evidence of

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.029
one of the world's most horrifying atrocities?"

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:36.599
"The Red Guards, Mao's armed revolutionaries
during the Cultural Revolution, probably destroyed

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.550
it."

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.750
The cover of Frank Dikötter's book features
one of these spurious photographs: the starving

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.979
boy with the empty bowl was photographed in
1946 by George Silk.

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:54.159
This photograph is actually indicative of
poverty and starvation prior to the Communist

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:59.349
takeover of government in 1949, and this is
the sort of inconsistency that denialists

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:04.000
will pounce on --and there are, indeed, millions
of people who are in denial about the great

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.599
famine, who would minimize its significance
or deny that it happened at all.

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:12.571
Whether you look at Chinese sources or Western
ones, the only images you'll find from this

00:07:12.571 --> 00:07:14.809
period are propaganda.

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:19.449
The people may look poor and tough, but you
never see starvation; and this was indeed

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:24.159
a period when millions of people were being
forcibly starved to death, and facing extreme

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:27.559
violence if they even dared to complain about
it.

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:29.439
How many millions?

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:34.490
Yang Jisheng uses a total of 36 million, primarily
arrived at through archival sources, such

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.599
as the ones I've already quoted from his book.

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:43.149
Frank Dikötter came to a significantly higher
total of 45 million, using a different methodology.

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:47.749
You might think this would be a polite disagreement
between scholars, but no, actually, the contentions

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:51.929
surrounding these estimates have become somewhat
impolite (with disagreements between the two

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:52.929
in print).

00:07:52.929 --> 00:07:58.110
Of course, those who want to deny or minimize
the famine use much lower numbers, but due

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.360
to demographic evidence there are no longer
respectable sources using estimates below

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.069
30 million.

00:08:04.069 --> 00:08:10.199
Of course, another significant issue is the
number of years that are included in defining

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:11.199
the period.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:14.009
Those who want to focus narrowly on the worst
years of the famine will tend to speak of

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:20.490
the three years from 1959 to 1961 (this has
been colloquially known as "the three bitter

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.490
years" [三年困难时期]).

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.180
A slightly longer time-frame is used for ideological
reasons, defining the disaster in terms of

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:32.870
the government policies that surrounded it,
from 1958 to 1962 (note that this does not

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:38.660
coincide with "the Great Leap Forward", as
that was considered to have ended in 1960).

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.050
Admittedly, if you're writing a book on the
subject, you need to stop somewhere, but there

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:48.390
is an argument for continuing to study the
famine period right up to 1965.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:53.060
If you look at this chart of grain production,
you can see that it's not until 1965 that

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.500
production per capita recovers to pre-crisis
levels.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.780
However, most of the books cited in this video
use a shorter time-frame.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.370
The current wave of publications on the Great
Famine and the failures of the Great Leap

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:09.210
Forward seems to have begun with a book written
in English, by a journalist living in Hong

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.680
Kong.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.180
Although I doubt that many people read his
book inside China, it is clear that the mere

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.881
existence of the book raised many questions,
and set new research projects in motion.

00:09:19.881 --> 00:09:24.310
In the western world, Becker's book had a
tremendous emotional and intellectual impact,

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:28.260
but it was generally dismissed by those who
wanted to make excuses for Communism, partly

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.570
just because the author was a foreigner, and
also because it relied on eye-witness accounts,

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:37.730
and used indirect and American-archived sources
(rather than the type of smoking-gun evidence

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.870
we've just been quoting from more recent research).

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.300
I'm not at all suggesting that those who dismissed
Becker's work were correct to do so; on the

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.390
contrary, more recent studies have backed
up many of his observations, but he lacked

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:54.470
the mountain of evidence to back up his claims
that later books would indeed provide.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:59.070
The next big step forward in the literature
was the research of Qiao Peihua, focussed

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:04.220
on the same example that I used to open this
video: Xinyang prefecture.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.740
This was published in Chinese in 2009, and
I cannot find any evidence that it was ever

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.480
translated into English (although some sources
promised that it would be).

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:17.300
It's significant to note, however, that Qiao's
work was already circulating in the year 2000,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.350
as shorter articles and as unpublished manuscripts;
you'll find that it is cited and named as

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:27.630
an inspiration by other books that were published
more recently than 2009.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.950
If the earlier work of Jasper Becker was lacking
the sort of massive, documentary evidence

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:37.090
that would force denialists to take it seriously,
we may say that Yang Jisheng's enormous two-volume

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:43.690
work was at the opposite extreme: it demanded
to be taken seriously.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.590
Although there are probably few people who
have read the whole thing, this book has had

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.330
a tremendous cultural impact in establishing
some of the basic facts about this period

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.930
of history in a form that most find irrefutable.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.050
It includes interviews and emotionally moving
vignettes along with hundreds and hundreds

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:03.340
of pages of dry facts, directly from the Chinese
government's own archives.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:08.670
Whereas Jasper Becker was a western journalist,
Yang Jisheng writes as an insider, as someone

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.270
who both understands the whole structure of
the Communist Party, and as someone who was

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.890
a sincere Communist in his youth.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:19.230
Although I'm sure that most people encounter
this book just in the form of a summary or

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.950
an article that is just a few paragraphs long,
they're aware that a mountain of evidence

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.680
stands behind it, and that has marked a new
epoch in the evaluation of 20th Century China's

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.950
history.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:33.490
Frank Dikötter's book, already mentioned,
came out during the years when Yang's work

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.430
was available in Chinese only (with no English
translation).

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.920
As Dikötter wrote in English, his work is
relatively easy to read, and relatively easy

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.250
to lift, at a mere 420 pages.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:51.360
Incidentally, when Yang's book was finally
translated into English in 2012, it was reduced

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.100
to less than half of its original length.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.970
Each of these books has built on the research
that came before, and the 2012 study by Zhou

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:04.410
Xun expands our knowledge partly by taking
a different geographical focus: she worked

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.230
primarily on archives in Sichuan and Guizhou.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.990
Although you might think we're now at the
end of a period of new archival sources inspiring

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.290
controversy, we may be just at the beginning.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:21.970
In 2013, a digitized collection of 7,000 primary
source documents became available to researchers,

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.290
a dramatic contrast to the difficult conditions
described by Yang and others, who struggled

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.160
to work with restricted materials in government
archives.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.281
Digitization may open the way to a slew of
new studies, although struggles with government

00:12:34.281 --> 00:12:37.070
censorship will doubtless continue.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.530
Meanwhile, archived government documents are
in some ways the least interesting of historical

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.880
sources.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.970
The two books shown here gained public and
political interest primarily because of the

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:52.120
authors' ethnographic fieldwork (or, in plain
English, because they contained original interviews

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.390
with survivors of the era).

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:59.070
As with Zhou Xun's work mentioned before,
these are also significant as studies of particular

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:04.510
areas within China, showing that each province
and each cluster of communes had significantly

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.140
different experiences of the same period of
history.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:15.040
So, this video has served its purpose in introducing
the subject, and introducing the new literature.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.000
In closing, we might ask, why is this happening
now?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.850
I think the answer is as simple as the old
Chinese propaganda slogan of studying the

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:28.900
past for what it can add to the present: although
there's an impulse to memorialize and mourn

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.940
the dead, nobody can doubt that this chapter
of China's history is now being used to challenge

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.740
the authority of the Communist Party, to make
a hopeless plea for accountability in a country

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:44.490
where the government is never accountable,
and to call for an end to an era of totalitarianism

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.880
that never really ended --an end to Communism
in China.
