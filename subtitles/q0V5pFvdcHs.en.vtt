00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.120
 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I know a true story of a miracle, involving
a Buddhist monk...

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Don't worry, this will be brief, and... [laughs]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.489
There was a very senior Buddhist monk from a Thai lineage, and he was surrounded by, uh...
hangers-on and flunkies who believed in homeopathy

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.530
and hippy alternative medicine, this kind
of thing.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.820
He had one of the problems in his eye that
required surgery, and if you don't get the

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.059
surgery performed on your eye it will progressively
get worse and worse, and you'll go blind,

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.839
it will become inoperable.
And he's surrounded by people who are telling

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.499
him, "Don't get surgery", "Use this alternative
medicine", "Use some kind of magical cure"...

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:09.499
And he decides, "Okay, I'm a Buddhist monk,
I'm supposed to believe in magic of various

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.820
kinds, I'll give it a try."
He takes off his robes, [and this is] controversial

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.410
[because] he's already breaking the rules
by taking off his robes and dressing like

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.520
a normal layperson,
he gets on an airplane, and he flies to India,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.520
to receive faith-healing from the famous Hindu
sage Sai Baba.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I guess I'm putting "sage" in quotation marks.
If you haven't heard of Sai Baba, he did all

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.640
kinds of magic tricks on stage, including
direct sleight-of-hand (real magician's tricks),

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.180
but he also did faith-healing.
[So this Buddhist monk] goes to be healed

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.110
by Sai Baba.
Standing in a row, there's a hallway full

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.090
of people getting healed by Sai Baba. I think
it's during his act, y'know, he performs on

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.749
stage, he heals people on stage, and then
he keeps going down a row [of], I dunno, a

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:14.819
hundred people (I don't know how many people)
who are waiting to be healed.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.489
He's coming down the row, and he's magically
laying hands on people, healing people, one

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.379
after another after another, and then he comes
to this Buddhist monk, who's dressed like

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:32.019
a normal person...
[Laughs] He comes to this Buddhist monk, and

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.239
he stops.
He looks him in the face, and he says, "Get

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:44.239
the surgery". [Laughs] He doesn't heal him,
and then he keeps going down the line, faith-healing

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.590
all the rest of the people.
It's a true story. It's a true story, and

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.109
it's the only miracle I can name for you,
because it's the miracle of a miracle-worker

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:02.109
deciding not to perform a miracle.
He did have the surgery. The surgery worked.

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:15.709
This isn't about to turn into a cooking show,
but I just made myself a vegan protein "milkshake"

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.540
and I thought, hey, keep it real, let it sit
out while I'm talking to the camera.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.540
[I'll] start with an example. Maybe the examples
are easier to relate to than the kind of theoretical

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.829
question I wanted to talk about, really quickly
in this video.

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:40.829
I had a guy visit me a couple of weeks ago,
and he's a smart, well-educated guy, probably

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.079
one of the smartest people I've talked to
in the last five years, and, uh, we talked

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.230
about Buddhism for several hours, and, of
course, by the end of that time he really

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.139
had a sense of how many years I've worked
on Buddhism and my depth of knowledge about

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.930
the history and other issues.
But then he stopped at one point, and he told

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.169
me with real excitement, after we'd been talking
about all kinds of problems of philosophy,

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:12.529
corruption, history, and he stopped and he
told me with his eyes glowing, that he knew

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:17.989
one Buddhist temple that didn't have any of
these problems, because, at this one temple,

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.989
he said, they just worship statues (they worship
this particular god) and if you ask them anything

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.590
about Buddhist philosophy, they just preach
the doctrine of "not knowing".

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.400
They just preach the doctrine that none of
them know anything, and there are no answers

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.400
to any questions. Sounds great. And, y'know,
this guy, again, he's not an idiot; he's really

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.110
quite bright, but I could see he was taken
in by this.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:59.110
And my response was not to question the value
of a bunch of monks preaching that they don't

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.220
know anything, but to ask him a hypothetical
question: how would he feel if I told him

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:15.259
the exact same thing about a Catholic monastery
in Italy, where the monks just worship a god,

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.120
and if you wanna ask them any questions, they
just preach their own pious ignorance? How

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.120
would he feel if I knew about an Eastern Orthodox
temple somewhere in Russia where people professed

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.440
the same doctrine?
Right away, his whole expression changed.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.440
The concept of "pious ignorance" has a pretty
deep history in Christianity, and, um, it

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.960
isn't well-suited to Buddhism at all. If you
know anything about the history and philosophy

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.210
of Buddhism, it's got to be the most anti-ignorance
religion going, although a lot of people conveniently

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.650
ignore that side of it.
But in posing the question in this way, what

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:09.650
I was challenging was the mystique of the
exotic that, really, for him, made the idea

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.419
of pious ignorance seem appealing. And, right
away, if he was just visualizing how he would

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:23.020
feel, how he would respond, if we were talking
about white, western people, doing the same

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:30.020
thing, with the same excuses, in a western
setting, then, suddenly, it didn't seem so

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:38.409
appealing anymore.
My own sense of apprehension of "the exotic"

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:45.590
and of how people tend to turn off their own
rational faculties once something is declared

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.830
exotic actually is much earlier than my interest
in Buddhism.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:57.219
When I was working on European philosophy,
I was shocked (shocked is the word) that there

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:04.069
were other people the same age as myself,
going to university, who were willing to pretend

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:10.129
that somebody living in 19th century Germany
(y'know, 19th century German philosophy was

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:16.270
somewhat popular at the time)... that someone
from 19th century Germany represented an "exotic"

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:22.080
and alien culture that was somehow disconnected
from the rest of the history of the world.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.930
And, of course, those philosophies (all the
philosophies of 19th century Germany) are

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:34.930
caught up in debates about racism, religion,
slavery. And other young people from the same

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.449
culture as myself, the same age as myself,
they were making excuses for these philosophers,

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:46.150
saying, "Well, uh, they didn't mean to be
racist, they just didn't know what they were

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.719
talking about at the time".
And whenever I would challenge that by saying,

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:56.310
"Well, what are you talking about? When this
book was published, we're just a few decades

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:02.770
before the American Civil War. All of those
debates around slavery, those are all in the

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.409
newspapers, in England, in France, and in
Germany. These are the events going on in

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:12.919
the British Empire and the French Empire...
it's just not true that people in Europe were

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:19.919
ignorant of the ethnic and religious politics,
of the issue of slavery in particular". But

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:28.020
I could see that in their minds, they were
trying to separate this exotic island that

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.820
their philosophy came from (their pet philosophy)
from the political and historical reality

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.959
of the rest of the world.
And a lot of white people around me do that

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:45.959
with Buddhism to an extent that I find scary.
It's not with a lack of sympathy that I say...

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:54.810
and, again, you can see something click in
people's eyes when you talk to them about

00:08:54.810 --> 00:09:00.450
this stuff... but if you're talking to someone
who thinks of a man wearing robes as if he's

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:07.170
ancient (as if he comes from 2,500 years ago)
and you say, "Oh yeah, yeah, I know the monk

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.260
you're talking about", or, "I know the temple
you're talking about".

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:17.260
"Yeah, the most senior monks there, who are
now retiring and dying of old age, those guys

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.790
were World War Two veterans."
"Yeah, yeah, and then the next generation

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:26.220
up, that replaced them, they had this kind
of education, they came out of this type of

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:32.589
military background, a few were farmers..."
As soon as you put it into the timeline of

00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:39.589
events like World War Two, the Vietnam War,
you can see that mystique of the exotic falling

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:48.490
from people's eyes, as they're forced to recognize
that we really are talking about modern people,

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.800
who are part of the same history, the same
ongoing history as the western world.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.899
And [we're talking about] people who've learned
about Buddhism in ways that are not so different

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:03.459
from ourselves.
I've had the privilege that many monks were

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:06.139
honest with me in talking about their own
background.

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:10.959
Many monks their story is, "Well, I finished
my life in the military, and then I tried

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:16.019
this line of work, I didn't like it, I thought
I'd try being in the monastery; I had a cousin

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:19.220
who knew somebody in this monastery, so I
went..."

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:24.519
You know, very human, the stories that bring
people into the life of a Buddhist monk. And

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:31.040
I say that with all sympathy. But you have
to sympathize with the human reality, not

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:38.040
with some kind of abstract, unreal, otherworldly
reality, that, of course, can never be real.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:50.470
When we set up a barrier between us and them,
and we look across a division that exoticizes

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:59.990
what's foreign, really, the most dangerous
part of it is that we're giving ourselves

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.470
an excuse to suspend judgement. We're giving
ourselves an excuse to turn off the rational

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:13.470
part of our minds, that we would apply to
even someone like a Catholic monk (instead

00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:20.139
of a Buddhist monk), and that we would apply
to someone who was selling you a medical treatment,

00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:27.139
as opposed to an "alternative" treatment,
or a religious practice that's supposed to

00:11:28.139 --> 00:11:33.860
get the same results.
When I look at the medical excuses that are

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:39.639
made for Buddhist meditation, and for buying
and selling Buddhist meditation, it's very

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:46.639
sad to me, in that way, because I feel that
the people who are willing to suspend their

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:54.690
disbelief for this exotic, foreign, religious
practice, would never do the same thing for

00:11:55.449 --> 00:12:02.009
prayer (Christian prayer), [they] would never
do the same thing for even exercise and changes

00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:06.410
in diet. They would be very skeptical if they
were told they would get the same results

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:12.320
from changes in diet and exercise, although,
scientifically, it may work, but there's just

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:19.320
enough of a veneer of the exotic for them
to turn off the critical faculty of their

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:26.839
brain, and embrace uncritically what's bought
and sold as meditation today.
