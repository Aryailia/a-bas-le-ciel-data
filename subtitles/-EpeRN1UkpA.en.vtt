00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.530
even earthworms want to see the sky what do you think about earthworms want

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:16.990
 see the sky sometimes sometimes they crawl out onto the grass sometimes they climb the very

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.950
 top of a dirty puddle do you think they want to see the sun the moon and the clouds

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:32.649
 as we do not know but birds looking down do you think they want to see

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:39.330
 the underworld like earthworms they see the same sky every day

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.490
 maybe sometimes they imagine another world down there where the earthworms are

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:52.450
 they fly they sit on street lamps and look down imagining the world up

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.740
 upside down in it earthworms on a small

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.750
 a lamppost looking up as the birds fly over

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.409
 by the lake do you think they want to see the underwater world like fish like you

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.909
 you think imagine and they are another sun and a dear moon there

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:20.560
 under water for all the fish in the sky, they see the sun, the moon and the clouds and imagine that

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.170
 fish have their own world with their own sun at the bottom of the lake when

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.909
 fish rise to the surface that they think they see some kind of algae or

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.289
 an octopus swimming nearby and in the sky above them another ocean upside down

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:47.530
 yes I suppose it is so earthworms want to see the sky birds want

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.560
 see the underworld and fish want to see another ocean in the clouds but how

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.219
 about pigs and cows what do you mean i think cows

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:07.209
 want to see the sky but all their lives they live inside millions of cows live on

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:15.400
 factories making milk and never see the sky i think pigs want to see too

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.989
 heaven but millions of them living their whole lives inside in factories in

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.459
 waiting for death when they look up they see only a metal roof and

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.730
 looking down all they see is the concrete floor maybe they are imagining the world

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:45.069
 outside that the sky is there of metal and that forests and fields are made of concrete and steel but

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.150
 because even earthworms want to see the sky
