00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.510
A major turning point in the history of China
transpired in the last few years, and will

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.990
continue to unfold through 2015.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.849
The change involves the two confusing concepts
that you see on your screen.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.420
Document Number Nine and the New Mass Line
Movement are major changes that have already

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.770
impacted the lives of millions of people,
with relatively little scrutiny from the English-speaking

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.420
world, perhaps just because of the short-term
preoccupation with wars elsewhere.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.810
To quickly show the scale and seriousness
of the subject, here's an excerpt of some

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.690
reporting by Gillian Wong.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.560
Quote, "[Mr.] Zhou, land bureau director for
the city of Li Ling, was confined in the party's

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.130
secret detention system at a compound in central
Hunan, touted as a model center for anti-corruption

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.519
efforts.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.530
Nobody on the outside could help him, because
nobody knew where he was."

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.390
"In a rare act of public defiance, Zhou and
three other party members in Hunan described

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.850
to The Associated Press the months of abuse
they endured less than two years ago, in separate

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.879
cases, while in detention.

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.780
Zhou said he was deprived of sleep and food,
nearly drowned, whipped with wires and forced

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.420
to eat excrement.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.340
The others reported being turned into human
punching bags, strung up by the wrists from

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.810
high windows, or dragged along the floor,
face down, by their feet."

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.480
Quoting from elsewhere in the same article,
"The party defines 'Shuāng Guī" as an order

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.070
to its officials to appear at a designated
time and place to account for their actions.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.619
Experts who study corruption statistics estimate
at least several thousand people are secretly

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.200
detained every year for weeks or months under
this system."

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.070
"Party anti-corruption experts acknowledge
that the practice is legally problematic but

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.409
say it's indispensable in fighting corruption.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.799
About 90 percent of major corruption cases
involving party members in recent years were

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.020
cracked through the use of 'Shuāng Guī,'
a party official said last month."

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.289
"Anti-graft authorities investigated 173,000
cases of corruption among members last year,

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.930
officials say, and at least three people died."

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.469
I have underlined the words "officials say"
just to draw attention to an obvious problem

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.140
with this type of statistic: if the official
propaganda says 173,000, the real number could

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.500
be ten times lower, or could be ten times
higher.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.160
Although you might expect government propaganda
to minimize the number of victims, this is

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.200
an official anti-corruption program that the
government is proud of, so we could instead

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.590
be looking at an upward exaggeration of the
figures.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.640
With this caveat stated, the number of people
disappearing and being detained is certainly

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.410
not small, and the shadow of fear created
by the victims is much larger than their numbers

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.410
alone.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.260
In contrast to the sympathy elicited by headlines
that might involve the clichéd "women-and-children"

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.310
of war, in this case, one of the obstacles
to western reporting is the latent bias against

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.310
the victims themselves.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.959
They are predominantly men in suits and ties
who have become rich as part of the Chinese

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.430
establishment --rightly or wrongly.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.530
When the target of repression is "corrupt
government officials", there's a significant

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.610
presumption of guilt in reporting, even amongst
those who would not normally condone this

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.120
type of repression.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.800
Although the vast majority of the victims
are not famous targets of derision like Bó

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.260
Xī Lái, they are (rightly or wrongly) presumed
to be persecutors of the innocent, as much

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.150
as victims of persecution.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.500
This is the type of moral ambiguity that fails
to make headlines.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.030
Document Number Nine was a leaked document
that seems to have served as a manifesto for

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.070
the current round of reform and retrenchment
of the Communist Party.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.980
It was linked directly to the president of
China by this reporter, Gāo Yú, who was

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.040
thrown in prison soon thereafter.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.120
Quote, "[Gao Yu] said in a speech in New York
last October that Xi Jinping, the Chinese

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.799
president, 'personally went over the whole
draft [of Document Number Nine] himself'.

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.140
[…]
In recent months, Mr Xi's administration has

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.189
repeatedly stressed that China must reject
the influences of 'foreign forces'.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.670
On May 6, a new national security report from
Beijing's International Relations university

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.420
said 'the export of democracy from the West
is a threat to Chinese political thinking.'

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.049
It added that 'Bourgeois Western ideology
from radio, newspapers, movies, literature

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.250
and education poses a severe threat to China's
lifestyle and culture' […]"

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.760
There's a theory that Gao Yu herself is responsible
for Document Number Nine reaching the public

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.840
in the first place, but whether or not she
was the source of the leak, she reported on

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.560
it, established the direct connection between
this manifesto and the new leadership of the

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.320
Communist Party, and then disappeared into
the prison system soon thereafter.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.750
Gāo Yú is an interesting historical figure
in her own right, and she has been imprisoned

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.370
at least twice before, serving six years in
the 1990s.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.940
In makeup, she might seem to be about the
same age as Xí Jìn Píng, but there's a

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.350
significant difference in age between them.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.389
Gāo Yú's generation will at least have an
indirect memory of the failure of the "Great

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.870
Leap Forward", and she will have very direct
memories of the Cultural Revolution, as an

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.710
adult witness to that period.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.490
At 61 years old, Xí Jìn Píng is actually
too young to share that perspective.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.400
Although it seems inescapable that someone
from Gāo Yú's generation would regard Document

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.310
Number Nine with fear and apprehension, the
attitude toward that chapter of history will

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.990
be different even for someone as old as Xí
Jìn Píng.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.259
If the future belongs to people under 60,
it's hardly surprising that Document Number

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:22.410
Nine itself shows so much interest in eliminating
"historical nihilism", and establishing the

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.730
authority of Chinese Communism in a narrow,
self-congratulatory interpretation of the

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.860
country's history.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.220
Nobody will be allowed to question the Communist
Party's mistakes in the future, and nobody

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.880
will even be allowed to evaluate the Party's
mistakes in the past.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.550
There will certainly be no freedom of the
press, nor even free discussion on the internet,

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.270
as the document takes some time to specify.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.130
In contrast to all the vague promises of prior
eras of political reform, Document Number

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.680
Nine sets down a starkly totalitarian view
of China's future.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.569
As with many other turning points in China's
past, the new direction indicated by the manifesto

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.800
has been demonstrated --first and foremost--
by the Communist Party turning against itself,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.250
purging, persecuting and imprisoning its own
members.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.710
Given the difficulty of reporting on Communist
Party officials persecuting one-another in

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.000
the tens of thousands, here's an example of
a report focussed on an aspect of the story

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.740
that can more easily be construed in terms
of "innocent victims", although in much smaller

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.830
numbers.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:27.080
Quote, "In one sign of [Xi Jinping's] determination
to quash all debate, China's vast and well-funded

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.590
security apparatus has been encouraged not
only to arrest all government critics but

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.290
also to harass and in some cases assault their
lawyers.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.570
In July [of 2013] at least 44 lawyers were
obstructed, detained or beaten up while trying

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.229
to represent their clients, according to records
compiled by the lawyers and seen by the Telegraph.

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:48.160
[…]
[One such lawyer] said he had been assaulted

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.510
by police in the past, but that the current
situation "is definitely getting worse".

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.910
[…]
At least 50, and perhaps as many as 100 people

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.150
have been arrested for supporting 'constitutionalism'."

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.169
Telling the story in this way appeals to the
audience's presumption that these 44 lawyers

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:05.500
were not corrupt, but are hapless victims.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.490
Of course, we don't have any more reason to
assume that the 44 lawyers reported here are

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.160
upstanding men of principle than we would
for the 173,000 victims reported before.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.440
In a situation where nobody gets a fair trial,
and nobody expects any of the facts of a case

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.729
to be established, the western press is simply
left to lament that this type of persecution

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:26.400
is happening at all.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.330
In the anecdotal discovery of what the government
is doing, we get a sense of the unfolding

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.490
drama without an explanation of the strange
Communist Party jargon (and "dialectical materialist"

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.700
reasoning) that has caused these persecutions.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:43.410
Quote, "[Xí Jìn Píng] has been an advocate
of Maoist self-criticism since 2004 and of

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.220
the mass line since at least 2006.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.770
He has been a long-term proponent of a tough
party stance on corruption."

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:55.410
"Since becoming president, Xi has required
officials to study Maoist theory, particularly

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.330
Mao's 'mass line,' which says that the party
should be both a part of the people and capable

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.570
of leading them.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:06.750
In turn, Xi has put limits on official banquets,
gift giving, and the use of official cars,

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.680
and has encouraged officials to interact with
the public.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.070
He has put in appearances at Beijing restaurants
and on busy shopping streets and has also

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:20.389
mandated --and, along with his colleagues
in the leadership, led-- numerous 'self-criticism'

00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:26.150
sessions, in which party cadres publicly evaluate
their own success in connecting with the people."

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.330
"Xi has effectively asked officials under
him to give up many of the perks of office.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.630
The stakes, he says, are the very survival
of the party.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.740
An educational campaign based on the famous
'Document Number Nine' has promoted what party

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.200
theory calls a 'sense of danger' about the
threat of the party's collapse due to internal

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.770
subversion and foreign attempts to undermine
it.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.480
For many officials, that has been enough:
Local officials complain about the drastic

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.470
drop off in official gift-giving across the
country, and the luxury sector has taken a

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.510
big hit as a result."

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:04.420
"For those who refuse to buy into Xi's project,
though, he has launched the biggest purge

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.720
in decades.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.850
His weapon of choice is the Central Discipline
Inspection Commission, the party's anti-graft

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:14.250
organization, which Xi has greatly strengthened
under the leadership of long-term friend and

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.750
ally Wáng Qí Shān.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.880
Wang has presided over the detention of hundreds
of officials across the party, government,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.080
industry, and academia.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.190
Those investigated effectively disappear from
the face of the earth and are subjected to

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:33.700
horrors one survivor recently described to
the Associated Press as 'a living hell.'"

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.601
That's an effective quotation in drawing together
the threads of Document Number Nine, the Mass

00:09:37.601 --> 00:09:43.510
Line, China's new leadership, and the persecution
now unfolding under the banner of an anti-corruption

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.510
policy.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:49.650
The most fundamental fact here is, simply,
that China is now in the midst of "the biggest

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.670
purge in decades".

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.360
That is something the outside world ought
to be extremely concerned about, and politically

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.750
engaged with.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.220
Although I would not say that the western
world has been silent on the matter, compare

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.880
the response to the kidnapping of 200 Nigerian
school-girls by the terrorist group Boko Haram.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.520
That story not only had an enormous response
in the press, but also entailed formal statements

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.310
by political leaders, and some degree of military
action.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.920
By contrast, I'd encourage you to attempt
to find any statement from your own political

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.490
leaders (wherever you are in the world) about
China's New Mass Line, Document Number Nine,

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:28.490
or the related persecution, imprisonment and
torture of many thousands of people in China.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:33.810
It hasn't entered the realm of political commentary,
let alone diplomatic overtures or hard foreign

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.850
policy.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.980
The Nigerian kidnapping case is clearly defined
in terms of inncoent victims.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:45.590
What's happening in China, right now, is on
a vastly larger scale, with much more important

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.610
long-term implications, but it can't be reduced
to such a simple equation.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.410
It is, apparently, safe for western leaders
to declare their moral superiority to Boko

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:59.860
Haram, and to call for the rule of law in
Nigeria; it would rather more daring to call

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.880
for the rule of law in China, or to openly
revile the new policy of the Communist Party,

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.660
as set out in Document Number Nine.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.140
I find that those who identify themselves
as left-wing have the least to say when China's

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:16.690
political policy is stated openly and directly,
as it has been under Xí Jìn Píng.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:21.450
The Guardian newspaper has its full archive
of articles available online; I could find

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:26.030
only two very informal mentions of Document
Number Nine, and perhaps two mentions of the

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.800
Mass Line campaign in passing.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.620
Although google-searches are imperfect, I
don't think that either one has been addressed

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.830
even once by "The Young Turks", a left-of-center
American news service, not even under vaguer

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:37.830
keywords of "China anti-corruption crackdown",
and so on.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.510
To some extent, the western world is trapped
in a pattern of wanting to pretend that China

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:45.751
is going to transform itself into a democracy,
despite every clear indication that it will

00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:47.520
not do so.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.010
The Communist Party is consciously and intentionally
pursuing a very different direction, and they

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.940
provide us with some very clear indications,
that we're choosing to ignore.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.620
They're not repressing the freedom of the
press and human rights by accident, but publishing

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:05.230
manifestos that explain how the current wave
of repression really is part of their long-term

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:10.330
vision of the future of their own country,
as a totalitarian state.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.000
Quote, "Six months after Xi Jinping became
president, he has confounded hopes that he

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.010
might tread a more liberal path.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.980
Instead, his administration has cast China
in the middle of an existential battle against

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:26.630
seven 'Western' dangers including universal
values, press freedom, civil society and judicial

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.380
independence.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.240
Not only have these topics been made taboo
on university campuses, but an internal memo

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.610
named Document No. 9 warned Party officials
that these subversions could lead to the country's

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.050
collapse."

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.390
Perhaps western diplomats and western authors
alike are reluctant to name another Great

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:48.160
Enemy of Democracy, given that the newspapers
are --for the moment-- crowded with contenders

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.160
for that title.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.040
As the year 2014 comes to an end, the western
world is unusually eager to have China as

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.010
an ally, although Document Number Nine and
the Mass Line movement have shown that China

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.810
now regards western democracy as its enemy,
and that they're willing to spill blood within

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.440
their own Party to prove it.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.250
There's a somewhat surreal contrast between
the renewed hostillities with Russia and the

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:13.680
quiet reception of China's ideological retrenchment
under the leadership of Xí Jìn Píng.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.000
Although the Ukranian border dispute is vaguely
reminiscent of Russia's Communist history,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.380
the conflict with China actually is about
confronting Communism, here and now.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.100
Although the Ukraine and Russia may have poor
records on freedom of the press, fair elections

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.620
and other human rights, their current governments
would never publish a manifesto declaring

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.680
that they were opposed to freedom of the press
in principle, nor that they regarded universal

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.750
human rights as an ideological threat.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:45.370
Meanwhile, China just did, and then proved
their commitment through purges and political

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.230
mobilization on a massive scale.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.680
That should be difficult to ignore; but it
seems to be easily ignored in the context

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.110
of current political distractions.
