00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.991
Hey guys, this video is to some extent about
veganism, vegan politics, animal rights, human

00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:07.541
rights, those concepts and how we use them
in vegan politics, but it's also with the

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:12.680
issue of belief itself.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.230
I got some intelligent questions, responses
and reactions to my recent video saying that

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.849
I do not believe in animal rights and some
of them may or may not have gotten the message

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.890
that in a more recent video, I think I uploaded
a day or two later, I also clarified in the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.189
very real sense I do not believe in human
rights, if we’re talking as a matter of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.860
belief, no that’s not something I believe
in, doesn't mean the concept is completely

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.739
meaningless and I put in some caveats and
counter examples in that self-same video explaining

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.880
my position on human rights.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.090
But I’ll show this intersects with practical
everyday questions of how we organize vegan

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.090
activism.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.210
I had a message in response to me, sent back
saying more or less, this is a paraphrase,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.520
more or less quoting; “if humans have human
rights, why would animals not have rights?”

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.700
Thus saying I'm using a double standard or
perhaps guilty of speciesism or what have

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.700
you.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.780
Now my perspective that question is just as absurd as saying if humans have poetry,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:25.820
why do animals not have poetry, so my claim
here is not that human rights don't exist,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.250
in some absolute ontological sense, I also
would not claim that poetry doesn't exist.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.469
However clearly when we're talking about poetry,
we're talking about something creative and

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:44.890
abstract and something that's you know deeply
couched in cultural and aesthetic considerations.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.530
Whether or not something is poetry, I mean
I can show you a poem translated from medieval

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.890
Japanese into English, modern English, and
you may ask yourself; Is this poetry?

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.350
And I can show you Sanskrit poetry translated
into English and you may wonder; Is this poetry?

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.359
And I can show you even poetry of twentieth
century poetry written in English in California

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.179
in the 1960s and you may ask yourself; Is
this poetry?

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.921
Whether or not something is poetry, whether
or not you can recognize it as poetry, whether

00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:19.900
or not you can appreciate or enjoy it as poetry
gets into a lot of tricky questions that are

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.470
not based in a strict and simple sense of
belief, right?

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.769
But if you ask me do animals have poetry?

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.150
My answer is no.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.750
Poetry is part of human society and we may
write poems for or about animals, we may project

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.739
poetic qualities unto animals in our works
of art, we may you know depict them in a poetic

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:48.720
way, we may in a sense have animal poetry
within human culture, but this is so to speak

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.520
a set of abstract and largely aesthetic values
human beings have created.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.800
And likewise when we talk about rights, human
rights, partly what we're talking about is

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.849
a very simple legal idea, I mentioned that
in an earlier video, do you or do you not

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.380
have the right to drink alcohol in a public
park, in some countries you do and some you

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.310
don’t, so that's the difference between
England and Canada, you know do you or do

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.650
you not have the right to drive a car under
these circumstances, those circumstances,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.800
it's different.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.550
And partly it's a very simple cut-and-dry
legal issue, but we all know to a large extent,

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.930
the reason why people get so emotional about,
the reason why people get so passionate about

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.629
human rights is that it also gets into this
realm of aesthetic, poetic and indeed ultimately

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:42.049
ethical issues, this is why people you know
become so animated about rights and why some

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:48.939
people find it convincing or moving to state
the case for veganism in terms of animal rights

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.189
or in terms of human rights, trying to say
this this is an extension of the anti-slavery

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.750
crusade at least.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:04.879
There's a quotation from Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan
that comes to mind. Hobbes says laconically

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:11.360
that these social conventions,
things like human rights, he is not, human

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.890
rights discourse didn't really exist during
his lifetime, but these barriers that define

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:25.190
society, they remain in place due
to the danger, though not the difficulty of

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.690
breaking them.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.010
And that's the other brutal reality of human
rights, animal rights, or what have you.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.380
To a large extent you know peace exists in
the shadow of war and discourse within polite

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.351
society is to some extent created, vitiated
and backed up by the threat of violence, it's

00:04:42.351 --> 00:04:46.720
by enforcement ultimately that questions of
human rights become so important.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.800
You know are you or are you not going to go
to a local city park and prevent someone from

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.940
drinking alcohol there, if there's no enforcement,
well if you have the law, either the people

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.930
can drink alcohol in a public park that it's
a civil right, it's a human right, or that

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.010
they cannot, one way or another this comes
down to matters of enforcement.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.110
And there also I have to say, if you ask the
question this way; do animals “have” animal

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.110
rights?

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.290
In the same sense that human rights, no they
don't because animals cannot enforce animal

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:25.670
rights, animals are precisely reliant on humans
to imagine and project these values, project

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.630
them onto animals and for humans to then
enforce these rights against one another.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.330
So again this is a unique asymmetry - and
many people including Tobias Leonardo in his

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.590
new book, which I'm going to do another review
on, maybe talk to Tobias also, invite them

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.090
to do a conversation or debate with me about
it - these are issues that other people in

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.770
the animal rights movement or vegan movement
recognize also, that this is fundamentally

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.680
different from a situation like the liberation
of slaves, where we can ask the slaves themselves

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:02.120
to determine their own rights and interests, to take on these responsibilities. Whereas instead we're talking about a situation
of perpetual dependency, perpetual inequality,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.620
even if you want to declare that all animals
are equal to humans, which some vegans want

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.410
to do, there's a perpetual inequality because
their rights are in fact our rights projected

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.910
onto them, created, imagined and enforced
by human beings and human values.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.060
So, for me a profoundly related issue here
comes up, from by watching a new video from

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:32.690
vegan gains, I think it is very easy for people
to imagine that if only we had a society in

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:39.660
which everyone mouthed these principles, in
which everyone either believed or recited

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.540
these pious hallowed principles we'd have
a profoundly more compassionate society, a

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.190
profoundly less violent society, so my point
here is, I do not believe in animal rights,

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.450
I do not believe in human rights and I think
some of the people who support and propound

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:00.470
these notions, they themselves also do not
believe them and yet they believe that the

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.300
world would be a better place, our society
would be a better society if only everyone

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.450
around them would pretend, would recite and
pretend they believed in these principles.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.860
That we would have a less and less violent
society, less and less of violence of man

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.210
against man, of the human beings against animals
and so on.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.530
I describe my philosophy as nihilism, but
specifically as historical nihilism, I'm really

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.990
interested in learning the lessons of history
and what that means to me is different than

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.050
what it means to someone who's an ideologue.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:35.350
If you believe this, I would urge you to spend
some time studying the historical reality

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.770
of Theravada Buddhist societies, whether you're
looking at medieval Sri Lanka or medieval

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:46.300
Thailand, these are societies, historically
that are many ways more appealing than a medieval

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:52.290
Christian society or a medieval Muslim society,
it is no doubt true that in many, many ways,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:59.280
living in medieval Sri Lanka, medieval Thailand
would be more pleasant than living in medieval

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.450
Saudi Arabia or even medieval Germany, medieval
France, right?

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.890
I don't, let's set that aside.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:15.580
However, it is very significant that in a
society, in a traditional Theravada Buddhist

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.950
society, where people would literally mouth
the words of non-violence and compassion,

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:26.310
day after day, year after year, in which chanting
these principles and believing in these principles

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:33.000
was a daily feature of society, it was a cornerstone
and bedrock of the religion, public religion,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.550
popular religion and also the religion of
state.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:42.440
Nevertheless, these were societies based on
torture, torture of human beings, exploitation

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.540
of animals and slavery.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.280
They had a very real slave trade, now it was
very different from the history of slavery

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.510
in the United States of America, but nevertheless,
slavery is slavery, and involved also the

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.750
whipping and torturing of slaves.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.390
But you know these are societies that preached
compassion to such a remarkable extent and

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:06.060
yet I mean in Sri Lanka for example, crowds
were delighted by watching someone being tortured

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:11.050
to death, you know with an elephant, having
a human being riding on an elephant, you know

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:16.030
crushing a human being to death and that elephant
tearing the person apart and so on, this was

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:21.380
not only form of torture and execution, but indeed public entertainment in the midst

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.970
of a society.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:29.950
Medieval Cambodia, or pre-modern Cambodia,
again profoundly Buddhist society and yet

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:35.620
they had their equivalent of gladiator games,
of men killing each other in public, martial

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:41.030
arts combat, fighting each other and crowds
would show up and cheer, and the parents of

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.610
the young men who would be seriously maimed and sometimes killed, you know, seriously

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:50.250
injured and sometimes killed, in these you
know public martial arts displays, seeing

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.840
no problem with it.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.520
And again needless to say, all of these societies,
the whole society ate meat, including the

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.720
Buddhist monks who preached these virtues
of non-violence and compassion, so I do not

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:07.370
believe in animal rights, I do not believe
in human rights, I do not believe in the efficacy

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:12.660
of belief itself, ultimately that's the point
of nihilism in my perspective is the critique

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:19.630
of belief, as such, the rejection of belief
and I think we can learn a lot from looking

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:26.200
analytically, sympathetically, but analytically,
at the real differences between historical

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.670
societies that have preached these beliefs.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:35.880
And please, I mean within living memory, you
had communist societies that piously preached,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:41.990
that piously believed in so many virtues about
human rights, I mean has there ever been another

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:48.710
society more fanatically devout in its belief
and espousal of human rights than the Soviet

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:53.740
Union, than Russia, the whole Soviet-aligned Russian
block.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.760
And yet what really were human rights in that
society?

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.670
Has there ever been another society more devoutly
and more fanatically obsessed with the rights

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.800
of workers?

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.800
Of labor unions?

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:11.450
And yet we all know in a very real sense,
the Soviet Union workers had no rights, especially

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:16.170
not the right to unionize, neither do they
have those rights in communist China, even

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:21.510
smaller communist countries scattered here
and there around the world okay.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.850
There is a profound lesson for us to learn,
that's directly applicable to vegan politics

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.910
in those cases, and there's a profound lesson
for us to learn about belief itself and ideology.
