00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.959
Hi. This is a video to talk about Pali. My
own experience learning the ancient language,

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:12.300
the most important for the history of Buddhism,
called Pali. It's especially important for

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.280
Theravada Buddhism, it's important for anyone
who is interested in Buddhist philosophy.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.150
It is a language that has important links
to many living languages in India, in Sri

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.390
Lanka, in Southeast Asia (Burmese, Thai, Cambodian,
etc.). This is a video that, obviously, people

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.470
have requested that I make for some time.
Why am I finally making it today? Well, funny

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:43.300
story, 30 minutes ago, my final exam for Japanese
ended. The end of my level 1 Japanese university

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.040
course. I am completely exhausted. I woke
up at about 6:00 AM this morning, I wrote

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.530
a two and a half hour exam. The reason why
I've got a beard is because I'm exhausted,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.150
I've been studying a lot, and burning the
candle at both ends. That's the first part

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.400
of the answer to the question, "How do you
learn Pali?" Like any other language, it is

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:11.250
a lot of work. It is a lot of hard work. But
the truth is, if I don't make a video when

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.800
I'm exhausted, I won't make a video at all,
because if I were well-rested, I would be

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.240
getting work done. So, in most of my videos
I look exhausted, and in most of my new videos

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.240
in the future I'm going to continue to look
exhausted, because that's when I set aside

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.400
the time to try to make a video and share
some of my thoughts and memories with y'all.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.200
My patron saint behind me (in case you don't
recognize him), that's Edward Snowden, looking

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.210
down over me. So you might have been expecting
a Buddha statue in the background, but no,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.760
I don't have that kind of stuff in my apartment.
In terms of what gets covered in this video:

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.180
number 1, I'm going to talk about some of
my positive experiences with learning Pali

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.710
as a language, with being a Pali scholar.
That's something I was, in as much as anyone

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.640
can exist as a Pali scholar, for years and
years, and I do have some positive experiences

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.560
to share. Just lately, in some e-mail correspondence,
I was made aware of the fact that almost all

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:15.340
of my writing online consists of warnings
for people learning Pali. Not necessarily

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.060
negative, but trying to warn you of dangers
and difficulties you're going to encounter,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.430
and a lot of my writing about my own life
gives a lot of emphasis to the sense of frustration,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.239
failure, disaffection, insuperable obstacles
that I encountered and that I expect others

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.120
will encounter in that field. So, in this
video, to start with, I'm actually going to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.090
say some positive stuff about my experience,
secondly I'm going to talk about the central

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.750
question of the work itself, "How do you learn
Pali?", "How do you teach yourself Pali?".

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.180
It is mostly going to be about teaching yourself
Pali because there are very few places in

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.849
the world where someone else can teach it
to you. You're expected to be an autodidact

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.660
absolutely everywhere, including Europe, Asia,
etc. And then Part 3: I'm going to give some

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.190
thoughts about why I quit. Why I'm no longer
a Pali scholar today. So this is going to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.670
be one long video. And it will be very interesting
to a small number of people, admittedly. If

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.900
you're seriously interested in Buddhism, if
you're seriously interested in why so few

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.989
people are really competent in Pali, why there
is so little new, original research coming

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.239
out, this is a good video to watch, and if
you're considering this as an option for yourself,

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.550
of course, this is a good video to watch also.
A small number of people who know me personally

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:46.060
may also find it interesting, or they may
not. Arright. The positive side of my experience

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.420
study Pali, which I never talk about. I never
want to sound like I'm boasting, and one of

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.290
the reciprocal aspects of that is that there
are people on the internet and in real life,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:08.750
too, face-to-face, there are people who denounce
me by claiming that I was never given access

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.810
to institutions that I was given access to,
by claiming that people never worked with

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.479
me or never could work with me who did work
with me. A lot of people, especially before

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.030
this Youtube channel started, a lot of people
would basically invent an imaginary character

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.270
for who they thought I was and they would
then attack that character, or invent reasons

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.860
in their own minds for what they thought were
my failures or my obstacles or why I couldn't

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.710
accomplish various things. And very often
what they were attacking me for failing to

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.960
accomplish were things I never wanted to accomplish
at all. And, of course, that's partly because

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:56.630
my own approach to the history is very sincere
but it is very realistic. I am not someone

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:04.970
who ever owned magical crystals. I've never
owned amethysts. I've never done Yoga. I don't

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.080
smoke marijuana. I am not a stereotypical
hippie involved in Buddhism in any way. I'm

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.560
not interested in glorifying the past. I have
a real, sincere interest in a lot of important

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.770
historical issues, like slavery and colonialism
and the opium trade, and I'm sincerely interested

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.630
in the ancient history of Buddhism, I'm sincerely
interested in the modern, contemporary, ongoing

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.080
history of Buddhism, but I'm interested in
real things. I want to deal with reality all

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.060
the time, and that does alienate me from most
of the people in the field, and that's why,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.509
both on the internet and in real life, a lot
of those people say bad things about me. I

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.740
hope you can tell, even from my tone of voice,
I really don't resent it. As I'm about to

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.820
say in talking about the positive side of
it that didn't create a problem for me in

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:59.100
the field, because the types of events and
institutions and opportunities that those

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.759
people would block me from are opportunities
I don't want. They're things I don't want

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:11.910
to be a part of. So, y'know, I don't feel
any sense of loss that I wasn't invited to

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.020
events that I would have refused to attend,
or that I would have just quietly avoided

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:26.100
ever attending. And the other side of that
is, these people who kind of put in the effort

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.729
or energy to try to hate me (and I just note,
hate is different from fear: there are people

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.850
who fear me and there are people who hate
me, those are two different things), those

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.289
people are really unaware that all over the
world I had the red carpet rolled out for

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:49.440
me, simply because I was a legit Pali scholar.
What does it mean to be a legit Pali scholar?

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.120
Some people judged me on the basis of my hand-writing.
I worked very hard on this language, and it

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.669
is not a spoken language, not a living language
you can really have a conversation in; I had

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:04.330
beautiful penmanship, and I don't mean writing
Pali in Romanized letters, I don't mean using

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.500
the same alphabet we use for English, y'know
I could read and write Pali in the Burmese

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:16.220
tradition, in the Sinhalese tradition (i.e.,
the tradition from Sri Lanka), Thai, Lao,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.560
Cambodian, and I also worked on some of the
minority scripts, because I was interested

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.699
in the orthography. So, branching off from
the word orthography, what were the positive

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:30.660
things I had happen to me, just by being a
legit Pali scholar? Just by teaching myself

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.449
the language, working very hard, putting up
a website, developing good handwriting, developing

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:40.479
a deep knowledge of the history, the literature
(again, I'm reading reading contemporary studies,

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:43.539
I'm reading ancient materials, I'm reading
all kinds of stuff), what doors did that open

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:50.830
for me? The stuff I cared about, again, it's
not some meditation retreat at a hippie institution

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.800
where people hate me, those were not the opportunities
I was looking for. What was rewarding for

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:03.400
me and the doors that were opened for me was:
I got to see stone inscriptions, in person,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:09.740
I got to see palm-leaf manuscripts, I got
to visit archives, and I don't just mean academic

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.639
archives, although that was also very rewarding
for me (all over the world, in Asia, in Europe,

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:19.050
I've seen important historical materials in
academic archives), I've seen archives inside

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:24.110
Buddhist monasteries, I've seen archives inside
museums and so on, too. I've had access to

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:31.669
wonderful, inspiring historical materials,
hands-on. That mattered to me. Those were

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:37.479
the doors that were opened for me. Those were
the people who respected me. Some of them

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:43.789
were individual scholars who knew me for years
and who respected my work (however you want

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.759
to characterize my work). People who were
experts and devoted their lives to this stuff

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:51.910
met me, got to know me at conferences, sometimes
at archives; some of the most important people

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.819
I met (I was spending all this time at archives),
I met those people at the archives. Some of

00:08:56.819 --> 00:09:00.139
them stayed in touch with me by e-mail for
years and years, others were people who met

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:07.769
me for 5 minutes once. Show up at a Buddhist
monastery, y'know, not just average Buddhist

00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:12.189
monasteries, but a Buddhist monastery where
I knew there was some kind of scholarly or

00:09:12.189 --> 00:09:17.189
historical tradition that was important, that
I wanted to connect with, and y'know, the

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:20.309
monks looked at my hand-writing, they looked
at my work, they asked about my background,

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:27.089
you have some kind of conversation about Buddhism,
and they unlock the door to whatever it is.

00:09:27.089 --> 00:09:36.730
You know, I was treated wonderfully at such
a long list of institutions. Again, I don't

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:41.139
get offended when people denounce me this
way on the internet; people say, "Oh, nobody

00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:44.800
in western academia could ever work with this
guy." And again, this is before [I was on]

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.079
Youtube, so people would imagine that I was
this very scary character. [They had] never

00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:55.369
heard my voice. I guess they found the textbooks
I made, the practical resources, they found

00:09:55.369 --> 00:10:02.499
that scary, I don't know. Most of it is pretty
boring. Yeah, my work on Pali grammar, pretty

00:10:02.499 --> 00:10:09.549
terrifying. You know, I had an offer to get
a PhD, I've had offers, plural, to get PhDs

00:10:09.549 --> 00:10:15.489
in England, in Germany, in the United States,
famous universities like Stanford in the United

00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:21.929
States… one of the things you can get out
of Google [is that] I did deliver this one

00:10:21.929 --> 00:10:25.809
lecture at Oxford university in the U.K. If
I had stayed longer at Cambridge I would have

00:10:25.809 --> 00:10:28.709
delivered a lecture at Cambridge (I had to
leave, I went to Cambodia, so I didn't stay

00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:34.929
long enough for that to happen). I delivered
a lecture at S.O.A.S. in London. When I first

00:10:34.929 --> 00:10:41.429
got involved in Pali, when I first decided
that it was really Pali that was the language

00:10:41.429 --> 00:10:49.589
that I was going to study, not Sanskrit, not
something else, not Mongolian, y'know, I made

00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:54.839
a list of who were the major figures in the
field who were still alive that I'd like to

00:10:54.839 --> 00:11:00.910
meet, that I'd like to contact or communicate
with. And much more quickly than I ever thought

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:06.989
would have been possible, I met all of those
people. Really, when I was still a beginner,

00:11:06.989 --> 00:11:12.629
I remember when the last person came off my
list, and I had to stop and reflect, "Wow,

00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:19.679
now every single person on my list I've either
spoken to in person, or I've had significant

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:25.999
e-mail correspondence with them over a long
time." There were people who were not on that

00:11:25.999 --> 00:11:33.519
list who I did meet and who I benefited from
meeting. Again, so, the positive part of my

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:38.119
experience is (and this is what I'm trying
to share with you, whoever is viewing this),

00:11:38.119 --> 00:11:43.410
if you are willing to do the work to become
some kind of legit Pali scholar, where you

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:48.379
have something to show your legitimacy, which
can be great hand-writing, it can be that

00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:52.699
you've done surveys of manuscript material,
you just got back from looking at stone inscriptions,

00:11:52.699 --> 00:11:58.379
you've done something that shows your legitimacy,
your sincerity, your hard work, your dedication,

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:03.230
your ability, your talent, your intelligence,
if you can show that, and you're not an eccentric,

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:08.429
you're not insane, you're not corrupt, you're
not a cult leader, because many people in

00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:16.829
this field are some of those things, if you've
got that, my experience is, many many institutions

00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:22.980
rolled out the red carpet for me, and treated
me extremely well. And I mean everywhere:

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:32.980
in Canada, in Taiwan, in Thailand, some of
these being elite, closed, Buddhist monastic

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:39.660
institutions. I was only in Bangkok for a
couple of days and on the basis of my reputation

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.199
as it was way back then, back when I had just
one small [web]site talking about how to teach

00:12:44.199 --> 00:12:50.029
yourself Pali on the internet, on the basis
of that website and maybe one or two causal

00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:57.600
articles, I got an invitation to go and meet
the most senior, scholarly monks at the Marble

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:05.139
Temple in Bangkok. That is an elite institution
and I'm not going to say it's hard for anyone

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:10.119
to go there, I think anyone, if they want
to see the architecture, can arrange to have

00:13:10.119 --> 00:13:18.009
a tour, but to get the invitation I got at
that institution is not easy. And it was easy

00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:24.499
for me, just for those reasons. When I was
in Sri Lanka, I thanked the people involved

00:13:24.499 --> 00:13:28.799
profusely, when I was in Sri Lanka I stayed
in the same Buddhist monastery that used to

00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:33.589
be the home of Bhikkhu Bodhi. When I was in
the United States I met Bhikkhu Bodhi, I talked

00:13:33.589 --> 00:13:38.999
to him for many hours, it was about a week,
I forget it was 5 days or what, it was a seven

00:13:38.999 --> 00:13:42.730
day retreat [or something]. I talked to Bhikkhu
Bodhi about his life, about studying Pali,

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.709
about Buddhism, about all these things. Y'know,
Bhikkhu Bodhi is as famous as anyone gets

00:13:47.709 --> 00:13:55.569
in this field. All these institutions, y'know,
in that sense, I had a wonderful experience,

00:13:55.569 --> 00:13:59.809
and I went into this as someone whose only
university degree is in Political Science.

00:13:59.809 --> 00:14:05.989
I don't have a university degree in Buddhism.
And, as mentioned, that's one of the things

00:14:05.989 --> 00:14:10.369
that makes me very different from other people
in the field. I remember I read someone's

00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:15.759
PhD thesis about Southern Laos. Laos is already
a small enough country but it had a long period

00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:19.619
of time when it was split into three kingdoms.
This was a PhD thesis about the Southernmost

00:14:19.619 --> 00:14:26.639
Kingdom. And this PhD thesis referred to it
as "a magical kingdom", as a wonderful place,

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:35.299
as this sort of paradise on earth. Y'know…
when I look at the history of that same kingdom,

00:14:35.299 --> 00:14:44.600
I see slavery, I see the opium trade, I see
the elephant trade. Yeah, there were rice

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:51.100
fields, but really the main cash economy had
to do with capturing slaves and capturing

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:57.779
elephants. That doesn't mean I'm anti-Lao,
on the contrary, I devoted years of my life

00:14:57.779 --> 00:15:03.629
to studying the history and politics of Laos,
ancient as well as modern, as well as colonial

00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:10.319
era. I was very interested in all of it, but
whether I'm looking at Buddhism in its strictest

00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:17.359
definition or I'm looking at a Buddhist society,
I don't have those rose-colored glasses on.

00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:27.669
I'm looking at what's really there, slavery
and all, wars and all, hypocrisies and all.

00:15:27.669 --> 00:15:31.589
Hell and the devil and all; I've mentioned
in some of my other videos, one of the biggest

00:15:31.589 --> 00:15:36.019
mind-games that gets played by Western Buddhists
is pretending that hell isn't in the Pali

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:45.609
canon. So I've had, in many ways, an enormously
positive reaction; I've had a lot of rewards

00:15:45.609 --> 00:15:54.979
for the effort I put into studying Pali, teaching
myself Pali. Now, to give one example of that,

00:15:54.979 --> 00:15:59.579
Richard Gombrich, who is still alive (he has
retired), Richard Gombrich is absolutely one

00:15:59.579 --> 00:16:06.509
of the most famous and powerful and influential
people in the Western study of Theravada Buddhism.

00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:11.879
He was not on my list of people I was really
trying to meet, honestly. I liked his first

00:16:11.879 --> 00:16:16.939
book, I had mixed feelings about his later
books, I'm a critic of some of his work, I'm

00:16:16.939 --> 00:16:25.399
appreciative of some of his work. He was giving
a lecture in Bangkok and I went to this lecture.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:29.949
And, y'know, I'm trying to only tell you the
positive side here, there are a lot of negative

00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:36.999
things I could say; this lecture in Bangkok,
the whole conference demonstrated many of

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:41.790
the things that are fundamentally wrong with
the study of Theravada Buddhism in the 21st

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:49.919
century. But Richard Gombrich was there, and
he gave an excellent lecture. When the other

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:55.199
speakers were giving their lectures, Gombrich
was sitting to one side (he was on stage,

00:16:55.199 --> 00:17:00.749
but not at the podium). And I remember, I
won't name who this is (a senior professor

00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:05.990
with a PhD who teaches in Europe), was giving
a lecture talking about Pali manuscripts,

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:11.639
palm-leaf manuscripts. And I did not say anything
to challenge her, I did not say anything to

00:17:11.639 --> 00:17:18.419
disagree with her, but when question period
came, I asked a question, and from the framing

00:17:18.419 --> 00:17:23.559
of the question, the phrasing and presentation
of the question, it was obvious that I actually

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:33.759
knew this material, and I hate to say it,
but, it was pretty obvious that she did not.

00:17:33.759 --> 00:17:38.370
Although she had read a well-prepared script
that was, ultimately, just summarizing other

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:43.340
people's research, she responded to my question,
having a very shrill voice, freaking out on

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:49.500
stage, and saying immediately (she didn't
know who I was), "Well, obviously, you know

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.880
much more about this subject than I do, so
perhaps you can answer your own question".

00:17:53.880 --> 00:18:02.320
This is supposed to be an academic conference.
Of course, she's scowling, and very negative,

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.360
and she never said a word to me again in my
life (neither by e-mail nor face-to-face),

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:13.279
and I had not said anything to disagree with
her or challenge her. But the one person there,

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:17.080
of course, who really responded positively,
Richard Gombrich brightens up and looks at

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.529
me, and you could see him ask the person [next
to him], "Who is this guy? This guy knows

00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:27.389
what he's talking about!" So that's the positive
aspect of it. A lot of people hate and fear

00:18:27.389 --> 00:18:32.309
Richard Gombrich (and, again, hatred and fear
are two different things). I think they hate

00:18:32.309 --> 00:18:38.720
him for all the wrong reasons. Maybe they
fear him for the right reasons. If you're

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.519
a fraud, Richard Gombrich can expose you as
a fraud. And, in a sense, in a really low-key

00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:45.659
way, that was what had just happened [with
the professor who became angry at me] at that

00:18:45.659 --> 00:18:50.460
conference. But Richard Gombrich saw me there,
he immediately recognized that I was not just

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:56.039
a talent, but someone who really had hands-on
experience, who had done the hard work, studying

00:18:56.039 --> 00:19:01.419
the language, studying the materials, being
out in the field. He invited me to dinner

00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:07.009
that night. We spoke continuously that one
night, y'know, the conference ended relatively

00:19:07.009 --> 00:19:10.769
early, academic conferences don't run until
late hours of the night, so we talked for

00:19:10.769 --> 00:19:15.559
hours, right then, the minute the conference
ended, and then he went to his hotel room

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:20.259
briefly to freshen up, then we went to dinner,
we talked for hours that night. Later, I met

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:25.269
up with him in England; he invited me to give
this lecture and said very flattering things

00:19:25.269 --> 00:19:29.620
[about it]. Ironically, (now, I'm only supposed
to talk about the positive things) ironically

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:35.100
there was a period of time when people in
Buddhist Studies hated me and said bad things

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:43.880
about me because I friends with Richard Gombrich.
So because this professor likes me, other

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:49.700
people hate me, because they think, "Oh, now
he's on Gombrich's side, those two are together".

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.090
At that very conference, just when I was first
chatting with Gombrich, saying, "Oh, yeah,

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:59.279
y'know, I live in Laos, this is the kind of
research I've been doing, this is the type

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:05.769
of work I've done the last couple of years";
just standing there in the hallway, the other

00:20:05.769 --> 00:20:10.549
professors who were there, the other professors
and graduate students, a couple of PhD students,

00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:16.409
stood in a group apart from me and Gombrich
in silence, in invidious silence, y'know,

00:20:16.409 --> 00:20:23.590
fuming. And [they] didn't say a word to us.
And Gombrich, of course, he's a very self-confident

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:30.419
guy, I remember, he turned to them, and, with
a somewhat beatific and yet challenging smile,

00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:36.370
sort of smiled at them, like, "Are any of
you even going to try to talk to me?" He was

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:40.909
right to give them the opportunity to come
over and talk to him: he's the leading figure

00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:45.200
in this field, in the field the conference
was about. At that conference he's the most

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.389
senior, most experienced most knowledgeable
person, [and] nobody wants to talk to him

00:20:50.389 --> 00:20:55.629
except me, because nobody has the guts. And,
look, why do I have the guts? Why did I have

00:20:55.629 --> 00:21:01.279
the guts to talk to these people? Because
unlike most people who come out of the British

00:21:01.279 --> 00:21:09.809
academic system, I was honest with everybody.
Sorry, one digression leads to another, but

00:21:09.809 --> 00:21:14.360
I'm giving you here a lot of the positive,
rewarding aspects of what studying Pali is

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.850
like, what it's all about. Don't lie to anyone
about your ability, your accomplishments,

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:23.629
your background. If you're an autodidact,
if you taught yourself, be honest about that,

00:21:23.629 --> 00:21:28.610
whatever it is, be "up front", because the
British in general are not, and that's what

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:33.740
you're distinguishing yourself from. Whether
or not you have a PhD, whatever your academic

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:40.659
background is. I remember I once spoke to
a very passionate Sri Lankan guy (who knew

00:21:40.659 --> 00:21:44.740
a lot about Buddhism and cared a lot about
Buddhism), we had this conversation about

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:49.789
the history of Pali as a language, about the
state of the literature, and he found me to

00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:54.289
be extremely well-informed and learned and
he was very interested in what I had to say.

00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:59.919
He said, "Tell me, what textbook are you using
to teach yourself Pali?" Now because I was

00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:05.909
really on the grind all the time, I was working
hard, I was studying while I was on the bus,

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:12.149
y'know, I was passionate about this language
and this area of studies, [so] I had it in

00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:18.610
a pocket in my jacket. "Here's the textbook",
I could show it to him, and this guy, he's

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.419
Sri Lankan, he's not a Pali scholar, but he's
a knowledgeable guy, he rapidly leafs through

00:22:22.419 --> 00:22:27.559
this, and he says, "This is much too basic,
this is much too introductory; based on this

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:34.200
conversation, you must be far more advanced
than this by now." And my reply, in that moment,

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.389
with no pause, no hesitation, I looked him
in the eye and said, "No, actually, I'm on

00:22:39.389 --> 00:22:50.309
page 25 of that textbook, but I know the first
24 pages exceedingly well." Don't be a fraud:

00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:54.809
be real with people. If you're passionate
about something and you're a beginner, tell

00:22:54.809 --> 00:22:59.960
people you're passionate about it and you're
a beginner. When you get to be more intermediate,

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.840
be honest about what your intermediate level
skills are and so on. And part of the reward

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:11.240
for that is that people will help you in a
way that's suitable to your level, and, hey,

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.879
people are going to hate you anyway. In this
day and age, I get hatred on the internet,

00:23:15.879 --> 00:23:19.850
I think all those other people, I think they
get plenty of hatred on the internet, too.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:25.110
So, y'know, it's not that you can't win, it's
that you can win, and you're also going to

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:31.009
have a lot of unreasonable criticism. So it's
part of the game. And, look, there are wonderful

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:34.159
things about that side of the game, too. As
I just mentioned, I started off with that

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:38.919
list of people I wanted to meet. If e-mail
didn't exist it would have been very hard

00:23:38.919 --> 00:23:43.240
for me to meet any of those people or I would
have just met them once in person, when they

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.919
happened to be in Cambodia, when they happened
to be in Laos, [or] these other places I was

00:23:46.919 --> 00:23:52.080
living, and then I would have never crossed
paths with them again. E-mail allowed you

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.999
to maintain those contacts. And sometimes
you meet people who introduce you to other

00:23:56.999 --> 00:24:03.200
people. Okay, look, that's the positive, wonderful
side of studying Pali. If you do the hard

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.889
work, if you're not a fraud, if you're honest
with yourself and you're honest with other

00:24:07.889 --> 00:24:14.809
people, if you're a sincere scholar, even
as a totally self-made scholar, and you're

00:24:14.809 --> 00:24:22.399
smart, you're not crazy, you're not trying
to start a cult, all kinds of institutions

00:24:22.399 --> 00:24:30.379
will open doors for you. And the institutions
that don't open doors for you, the people

00:24:30.379 --> 00:24:37.610
who try to avoid you, try to have sympathy
for them, a lot of the time they have something

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:42.330
to hide. [This is] not only my experience,
I've talked to other people who were reasonably

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:46.850
advanced in Pali, where they talked to me
about their experience, they went to see a

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:52.870
Buddhist monk, [and] as soon as it became
clear that this person, the visitor, knew

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:57.519
more Pali than the Buddhist monk, suddenly
the whole mood changes and doors get closed,

00:24:57.519 --> 00:25:01.740
and nobody wants to put up with you. Even
in an academic setting, several times I went

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:08.159
and met with professors and then as soon as
it became clear what I had accomplished and

00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:13.759
what level I was at (which can come out in
funny ways when you're talking to a professor),

00:25:13.759 --> 00:25:19.830
then they didn't want to be in the same room
with me any more. I remember one university,

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:24.999
all of the professors (they had a big department
of Buddhist Studies), all of the professors

00:25:24.999 --> 00:25:29.919
who were really confident in their area of
expertise (the specialists on ancient Chinese

00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:35.539
literature, Chinese Buddhism, Japanese Buddhism,
Korean Buddhism, whatever their field was),

00:25:35.539 --> 00:25:39.409
the ones who were really confident in their
languages and so on, met with me, and they

00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:43.429
had looked at my work and my C.V. and were
happy to talk to me, they offered to publish

00:25:43.429 --> 00:25:47.370
my work, they offered to take me on as a graduate
student, y'know, as I say, they kind of rolled

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:51.929
out the red carpet, it was wonderful. But
the one professor at that same university

00:25:51.929 --> 00:25:57.299
who never met with me, who never responded
to any e-mails from me, was the one professor

00:25:57.299 --> 00:26:05.519
who was supposed to be specialized in Pali.
And I sympathize, to some extent, but probably

00:26:05.519 --> 00:26:10.590
that guy didn't want to talk to me because
he looked at the materials I'd sent and he

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:17.649
probably felt afraid that I was a challenge
to his authority. That, or he may also have

00:26:17.649 --> 00:26:29.240
had supernatural beliefs that made him uncomfortable
meeting me. That's also part of the game.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:38.539
Part two. I said there were three parts to
this discussion. I'm glad I did part one,

00:26:38.539 --> 00:26:43.129
though, because most of the material you'll
read from me on the internet is very negative,

00:26:43.129 --> 00:26:47.460
is warning you about how hard this road is
to walk, how little there is waiting for you

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.230
when you get to the end of the road, and the
problems you're going to encounter on the

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:59.740
way. Part two, learning the language. Look,
I had no teacher for this language. I met

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:05.480
Bhikkhu Bodhi, I spent time with all kinds
of Buddhist monks, nobody helped me learn

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.759
the language. Nobody even gave me advice,
except for, I guess, negative advice, telling

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:16.590
me, "Oh, this institution is a scam, this
one is bad," that kind of steering-down-the-road.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:22.169
The number one mistake I made, my number one
regret was that when I started working on

00:27:22.169 --> 00:27:29.350
the language, I was working on poetry. My
line of reasoning for this, it was partly

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:34.399
based on what I'd read about Sanskrit, about
methods of teaching yourself Sanskrit and

00:27:34.399 --> 00:27:38.759
the historical tradition of how people transmitted
and practiced these languages within India

00:27:38.759 --> 00:27:48.610
(ancient India, of course). I thought the
best way for me to be able to study Pali 24/7

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:53.669
would be to memorize short passages of poetry,
to pick up that vocabulary and then to be

00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:57.799
able to go over those poems with a fine-toothed
comb and take apart the grammar and so on.

00:27:57.799 --> 00:28:03.919
So that's not a totally stupid idea, it's
not a terrible idea, but I regret it. I wasted…

00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:12.450
in my first year I wasted so much time and
effort because I was working on the poetry.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:19.070
What you really want to work on within Pali
when you're getting started ideally is a chrestomathy,

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:26.340
a selection of passages, of very plainly-written
narrative. I mean, I can remember, so I'd

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.869
been working on poetry for some time, and
then I opened the Pali canon, I was reading

00:28:31.869 --> 00:28:37.639
a particular passage [that] interested me
for whatever philosophical reason, and [there]

00:28:37.639 --> 00:28:41.570
was just this incredibly simple sentence,
where it said something like, "And then the

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:47.869
Buddha came down the mountain and walked along
the road that led to the river, and there

00:28:47.869 --> 00:28:56.139
was a small army-town there." Reading that,
it's kind of ridiculous to say, but I felt

00:28:56.139 --> 00:29:02.249
like I was reading English, in contrast to
the way the language is used in the poetry,

00:29:02.249 --> 00:29:11.470
the expression was so simple and so clear
and so lucid, and, y'know, this was such a

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:16.249
contrast. When you are first learning the
language that is the type of material (from

00:29:16.249 --> 00:29:19.899
within the Pali canon) that you want to be
reading. Naturally, if you're interested in

00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:26.360
the philosophy, you may want to immediately
start with reading dense philosophical passages,

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:31.769
[but] you can't do that with any language.
You can't do that with French or Dutch or

00:29:31.769 --> 00:29:38.369
German. If you're learning Italian you can't
start with dense philosophical passages or

00:29:38.369 --> 00:29:47.809
dogmatic religious statements. What you really
need to work on is that boring, practical,

00:29:47.809 --> 00:29:54.100
narrative use of the language, which is almost
all going to be 3rd person, past tense, "He

00:29:54.100 --> 00:30:00.259
walked down the road". I've done a lot of
work… the reason why most people… well,

00:30:00.259 --> 00:30:05.369
okay, a large percentage of people who know
me on the internet know me because I made

00:30:05.369 --> 00:30:09.779
textbooks available as PDFs, I worked very
hard to make educational materials available

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:13.960
so that other people could study Pali. You
can get that, if you don't already know, if

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:19.440
you google my name, you can get it various
ways. Within Google Books I digitized some

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:25.360
of them so that within the Google Books framework
it'll be permanently available, you can download

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.919
the PDFs, and [also] through different websites
that I don't update any more, you can also

00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:34.240
download those. Some people have used them
for years. The textbooks I made, I'm aware,

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.159
because I speak to Buddhist monks and I get
e-mails from Buddhist monks, and I've seen

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:42.980
it mentioned in print in various places, the
resources I made to help people learn Pali

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:49.899
have been used by Buddhist monks in Nepal,
in Hong Kong, in Myanmar, in Taiwan, around

00:30:49.899 --> 00:30:54.429
the world. And, of course, I assume they're
predominantly used by people who speak English,

00:30:54.429 --> 00:30:58.960
because they're in English. I've had some
indication that somebody in Russia is using

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:05.830
my work, which is great, they never talk to
me, whoever the Russians are. Obviously, some

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:11.039
of those languages, there's not that much
available for people who are serious about

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:17.249
learning Pali. The lowest level of pedestrian
communication in the language, in some ways

00:31:17.249 --> 00:31:22.289
the most boring use of the language, is what
you really need to work on when you're first

00:31:22.289 --> 00:31:28.340
starting. And you're not going to find that
prepared for you, you're going to have to

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:35.119
have a copy of the Pali canon and, in effect,
prepare your own selections, find passages

00:31:35.119 --> 00:31:40.480
that you can read and study that use the language
in that direct, narrative way, not philosophy,

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:51.049
not poetry, other types of stuff. One of the
other things I'm known for is the emphasis

00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:57.909
that all of my materials give to orthography,
to the writing systems. You need to be able

00:31:57.909 --> 00:32:04.440
to read Pali comparatively in more than one
edition. So, right off the bat, develop the

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:10.480
ability to read Pali in Burmese script, in
Cambodian script, in Sinhalese script (the

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:16.029
script of Sri Lanka), develop the ability
to have open in front of you more than one

00:32:16.029 --> 00:32:21.879
paper book with more than one version of the
Pali canon, of whatever Pali text you happen

00:32:21.879 --> 00:32:32.330
to be reading, so that you can do comparative
reading between them. What does that win you?

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:36.960
What do you get for that? … I remember talking
about this with Richard Gombrich, I remember

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.799
talking about this with a list of professors.
I mean, some of the professors, I remember

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:46.179
talking to one professor who I won't name,
and, y'know, the questions he was asking me,

00:32:46.179 --> 00:32:50.279
even though he himself had a PhD and was (in
theory) teaching Pali at a graduate level,

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:55.529
a lot of the questions he asked me I would
have taught in a 101 course, in a Pali 101

00:32:55.529 --> 00:33:03.539
course, they were really basic subjects, basic
questions of where the books come from, which

00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:09.070
books to use, basic questions you need to
know to do any research or just to study the

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:13.269
language itself. And I appreciated his honesty
that he would ask me those questions, and

00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:18.649
I was happy to answer them for him. This is
one of the other problems with learning Pali,

00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:24.610
most of university programs will just waste
a lot of your time. They may give you an irrelevant

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:30.710
education in Hinduism, in Sanskrit, if you're
in a program of Religious Studies you may

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:38.820
spend a lot of your time debating Max Weber
and the history of Protestantism, and theoretical

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:46.320
ideas about the study of religion in academia.
It's not a complete waste of time, but it

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:51.850
is an obstruction to you actually doing the
work of becoming a Pali scholar. And this

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:57.659
is one of the reasons why many people who
have PhDs related to Pali don't have any of

00:33:57.659 --> 00:34:01.590
the practical knowledge or skills or experience
that I managed to get in just my first few

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:07.830
years. They haven't been out living in "the
jungle" (the jungle in quotation marks)…

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:14.559
I spent some time literally in the jungle,
when I was in North-Western Laos… but, they

00:34:14.559 --> 00:34:24.230
haven't been out in Southeast Asia or Sri
Lanka doing hands-on work. Nor, in their own

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:28.210
apartments, are they sitting alone with the
books open hitting the language heavily. They're

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:34.440
generally spending their time coping with
harassment within a Western academic program.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:40.460
Spending a lot of their time and energy managing
the mood-swings of their supervisor, [of]

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:46.079
the other grad students, and attending lectures
that, again, lectures that may be related

00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:51.909
to Asian Studies, or Religious Studies, or
may address theoretical questions that are

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:58.880
currently fashionable, may have a lot of talk
about Foucault or whatever the current, trendy

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:04.650
philosopher-theoretician is, but they're not
doing the work. And they're also not really

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:10.819
going to be receiving instruction in the language,
in the real praxis of reading and writing

00:35:10.819 --> 00:35:17.299
and studying the language. So whether you're
in an academic situation or not, whether you're

00:35:17.299 --> 00:35:21.049
in a Buddhist monastery or not (because some
people watching this may be Buddhist monks

00:35:21.049 --> 00:35:28.040
in monasteries, thinking, "Yeah, I want to
do better than this Canadian guy"), 99% of

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:35.859
the work is going to be you, alone, as an
autodidact. I met, face-to-face, some of the

00:35:35.859 --> 00:35:42.430
last Buddhist monks to really be products
of the old education system in Pali. That's

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:48.210
partly because I did all of this research
on [Pali grammatical textbooks], on the history

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:55.619
of pedagogy for the language. This raises
a number of interesting subjects that may

00:35:55.619 --> 00:36:05.150
be useful for people to hear about. I met
one Buddhist monk, he was an older guy, I

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:11.049
guess he was 55 or 60 when I met him; when
he was about 8 years old, he studied with

00:36:11.049 --> 00:36:17.230
the last traditional master of the Pali language
in Sri Lanka, who was then a monk of more

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:22.960
than 90 years old. So that guy I met, he was
one of the last links to the old ways from

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:32.750
the old days for how Buddhist monks used to
learn Pali. It's gone. When you meet Buddhist

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:38.559
monks, or Asian people, Asian laypeople who
grew up in a Buddhist society, if they have

00:36:38.559 --> 00:36:44.460
mastered the Pali language, and they're under
90 years of age, I guarantee you they learned

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:50.490
Pali pretty much the same way I did. And the
textbooks they use, even if they're not directly

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:56.180
using western textbooks, you'll be surprised
to find if you look into the educational materials,

00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:00.319
which I did extensively, for more than 10
years (I was looking at "What are the textbooks

00:37:00.319 --> 00:37:07.470
used to teach Buddhist monks in Thailand,
in Sri Lanka, in Laos, in Cambodia, in Western

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:14.059
academia, everywhere?", I was looking at textbooks,
pedagogy, I was not interested in theoretical

00:37:14.059 --> 00:37:20.619
grammar, I was interested in actual grammar,
how it's learned and taught and used in language-acquisiton,

00:37:20.619 --> 00:37:27.319
how the language is tested, how exams are
conducted, all of those questions), everyone

00:37:27.319 --> 00:37:32.520
you meet today who either really is a Pali
scholar or who claims to be will have learned

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:42.160
in the Western-influenced style. Now, if you
look at my published work, so far I have only

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:50.290
said bad things about this, I think, because
I was mostly talking about colonialism. And,

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:56.049
y'know, European colonialism in Southeast
Asia was ugly and brutal and killed people,

00:37:56.049 --> 00:38:02.780
and burned down Buddhist temples, looted Buddhist
temples of their works-of-art, and piled up

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:09.319
Buddhist manuscripts and lit them on fire.
That brutality is real. What I've never talked

00:38:09.319 --> 00:38:12.940
about (just because my career as a Pali scholar
didn't last long enough) [is that] there are

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:21.819
also positive elements to that very sad history.
I found a lot of obscure publications produced

00:38:21.819 --> 00:38:36.130
in Myanmar during the first explosion of scholarly
excitement when Western technologies and Buddhist

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:43.099
traditions came into contact with one-another.
When, under the British Empire, in Myanmar,

00:38:43.099 --> 00:38:50.770
in Burma, you had for the first time Pali
schools being set up (there was just one in

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:57.770
Rangoon) where they used a European-style
system of examinations, of textbooks, of tests

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:03.160
and of language-exercises, directly imitating
the way Ancient Greek was taught in Europe

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:09.390
(to some extent how Latin was taught in Europe).
And of course Europeans also brought the technology

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:15.180
of modern book-making, book-binding, so (instead
of palm-leaf manuscripts) having ink on paper

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:24.460
for the first time. Although my printed work,
so far, focuses almost totally on the devastating,

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:30.910
sad, terrible, evil aspects of European colonialism,
the positive side was that a lot of local

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:36.150
people said, "Wow, this is my opportunity
to publish that book I was always wanting

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:40.950
to publish". You know, maybe their first contact
with the technology of book-publishing. And

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:49.280
those impulses did not just come from the
center. For example, in Myanmar, if you look

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:57.530
up the name James Grey, James Grey was producing
some of the first Pali textbooks that were

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:02.660
European-style textbooks, you know, fill-in-the-blank
exercises, these kinds of things, modeled

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:07.710
on ancient Greek and Latin, and Pali exams,
coming in and writing an exam, the way we

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:12.000
in the modern West would think of it, so people
would prove they had learned the language.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:19.210
The arrival of these methods… people didn't
respond to this as oppression, because at

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:25.670
that time the traditional system was still
vibrant, many people said, "Wow, this is great,

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:30.240
this is an opportunity, this is a new way
to learn, or a new way to prove what you've

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:36.000
learned". You know, traditional methods rely
much more on authoritarian relationships between

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:45.480
a senior monk and a younger monk, memorization…
I won't get into it, if I digress into that,

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:57.480
this video will be even longer. But the arrival
of those European scholars, those European

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.410
technologies-of-scholarship, technologies-of-education,
methods of pedagogy, the positive aspect of

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:06.599
that was (in the short term) that it touched
off a revival of scholarly interest in Pali,

00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:13.950
within countries like Myanmar and Sri Lanka.
Now the bad news is, this was part of a colonial

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:20.650
regime that devastated Buddhism and devastated
local political autonomy, devastated the local

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:25.940
society, that led to the collapse of many
things in the culture, [there are] many bad

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:30.569
things to be said about it. Cambodia is sort
of an interesting exception to the rule that

00:41:30.569 --> 00:41:36.660
confirms the rule. The history of the Institut
Bouddhique, the French Buddhist Institute

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:42.589
in Cambodia, has actually been written about
relatively extensively (in French, but also

00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:51.140
in English). I think they did that mostly
out of envy, looking at what the Royal Asiatic

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:55.520
Society was doing in Sri Lanka and elsewhere
and they said, "Well, we have to put a respectable

00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:06.010
face on the fact that French dominion now
controls places like Cambodia and Laos." And,

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:11.349
y'know, I got to see the last gasp of that
tradition when I was living in Cambodia and

00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:15.819
Laos. Among the people who opened the doors
for me and treated me so well [were] the people

00:42:15.819 --> 00:42:22.299
who controlled the École française d'Extrême-Orient,
that's the (literally) the French school of

00:42:22.299 --> 00:42:28.140
studies in the Far East, in the Extreme Orient.
In Vientiane, in Laos, they were wonderful

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:32.760
to me, they opened the door for me, they gave
me access to all kinds of scholarly resources,

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:40.130
in their archives and so on. And, by contrast,
the people in the same institution in Cambodia

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:45.000
treated me like garbage, but hey, y'know,
it is what it is. Some of those guys talked

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.520
to me by e-mail, the guys in Phnom Penh, but,
y'know, in general, they were not interested

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.270
in talking to me in Phnom Penh, and that,
of course, reflected the fact that the particular

00:42:54.270 --> 00:43:01.720
people, were they open to Pali scholarship,
as opposed to Sanskrit, as opposed to being

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:07.190
interested in archaeology, art history and
other subjects. But I got to see the end of

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:19.240
that tradition when I was in the former French
colonies of Southeast Asia. The work of learning

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:26.490
Pali is in some ways the same as any other
language and in some ways it is uniquely difficult,

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:35.530
and uniquely awful. You have to have incredible
motivation, incredible stamina, and incredible

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:42.619
focus. During the more-than-ten-years I was
involved in Pali you have no idea how many

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:47.079
people got in touch with me by e-mail saying,
"Yeah, I'm into this, I'm 100% committed to

00:43:47.079 --> 00:43:51.809
this, I'm going to learn this language, I'm
going to become a scholar in this field",

00:43:51.809 --> 00:43:57.369
and then at some point, two years later, five
years later or what-have-you, they're gone,

00:43:57.369 --> 00:44:03.480
they drop out. And of course I can sympathize
with why. [It is an] enormous sacrifice of

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:08.869
your time, and as I've said to many people,
if you compare it to learning how to play

00:44:08.869 --> 00:44:16.760
the guitar, learning how to play the guitar
is a lot easier, the rewards, socially, even

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:23.670
economically, are much greater, and, y'know,
people aren't going to hate you for it. People

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:28.230
will love you for being a legit Pali scholar
but people will also hate you, because you're

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:33.900
a threat to religious authority, you're a
threat to certain political assumptions. Sometimes

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:42.690
you're a threat to national pride. There was
a guy in Thailand (and I don't want to shout

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:48.680
out his name), I remember… he was based
in Bangkok, and he had connections to the

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:53.349
universities there, but only informal connections,
he wasn't a professor, he was just present

00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:59.869
as a self-made scholar in Bangkok. And when
I was out in the remote North-West of Thailand,

00:44:59.869 --> 00:45:08.059
where I was speaking Lao not Thai, I remember
I spoke to a woman who didn't seem to have

00:45:08.059 --> 00:45:11.980
any formal education, but she cared about
Buddhism, and she said to me passionately,

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:17.910
she said, "You know, there's this one foreigner
in Bangkok, and he's a real scholar of Buddhism,"

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:22.329
(which is true, that's a reasonable compliment
to give the guy), "He's a real scholar of

00:45:22.329 --> 00:45:27.369
Buddhism, and whenever he goes to academic
conferences in Bangkok, all the Thai scholars

00:45:27.369 --> 00:45:32.210
have to hang their heads in shame and be silent,
because that guy, that foreigner (he's a white

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:37.520
man, he's a westerner), he really knows his
stuff, and the professors in the Thai universities,

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:43.940
they're all corrupt, and they don't know what
they're doing." That might be a slight exaggeration,

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:48.589
but there was a lot of truth to it; and what
shocked me was that I was standing on the

00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:53.260
banks of the Mekong river, I was in the middle
of nowhere, and I was talking to somebody

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:58.950
who was not a career academic, somebody who
I believe had no university diploma at all,

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:05.859
and she knew this. She was in-the-loop for
this "gossip", or whatever you want to say.

00:46:05.859 --> 00:46:12.630
So that reflects [the fact that] just existing
as someone who can offer a dissenting opinion

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:20.789
about history, about the language, about the
religion, that's a threat that is really felt

00:46:20.789 --> 00:46:29.539
at the core of these very conservative, very
hierarchical institutions, in Thailand as

00:46:29.539 --> 00:46:34.160
[the] example. And many people will say to
you, well, Thailand [is] a relatively easy-going,

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:41.869
open-minded culture, compared to Taiwan, compared
to Japan. You want to talk about orthodoxy,

00:46:41.869 --> 00:46:46.450
I can tell stories about Japan, y'know, having
academic conferences where nobody's allowed

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:52.950
to ask any questions, getting peer review
back that says, "You dared to criticize this

00:46:52.950 --> 00:47:00.049
other publication therefore we're not going
to publish this". You're dealing with the

00:47:00.049 --> 00:47:05.940
most conservative and most hierarchical aspect
of these different cultures, and Sri Lanka…

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:11.589
tempers get really hot in Sri Lanka. In some
ways it's better than the kind of silence

00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:17.089
imposed on Buddhist Studies in the rest of
Asia, but in Sri Lanka people will scream

00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:24.660
at you, and I think people get into fist-fights
with you often enough, too. I say this, and

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:31.549
look, you know, my research is not controversial.
It shouldn't be by any reasonable standards.

00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:36.299
If I had been working on Ancient Greek or
Latin, nothing I have to say would be considered

00:47:36.299 --> 00:47:41.460
controversial. During the years that I was
a Pali scholar I openly identified as Buddhist.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:47.760
I was fundamentally pro-Buddhist, and that
doesn't mean that I was uncritical of Buddhism.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:54.520
I'm not pro-slavery, I'm not in favor of men
and women having unequal rights (I support

00:47:54.520 --> 00:48:00.470
men and women having equal right), I support
democracy, I don't support ancient kingdoms.

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:04.720
None of that, I felt, disqualified me as a
Buddhist, as someone who could make a positive

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:10.390
contribution to the scholarship and the religion.
I considered myself an advocate for the religion.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:15.460
I considered myself somebody who not only
was willing to discuss Buddhist Philosophy

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:20.900
and history as interesting, but really, during
those years when I was a Pali scholar, I felt

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:25.839
that I was somebody who could positively preach
some of that stuff. You know, propound it

00:48:25.839 --> 00:48:37.140
in a non-objective way. All is impermanent.
Life is suffering. There is no soul. To me,

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:41.130
those things are still worth talking about,
they're still worth preaching and so on. And

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:47.190
in terms of the cultural aspect of it, all
these countries have cultural problems and

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:52.720
political problems, believe me, Cambodia,
Laos, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, they got

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.789
problems. I'm not interested in rose-colored
glasses, I'm not interested in glorifying

00:48:56.789 --> 00:49:09.220
them uncritically. But, compare them to Indonesia.
Compare them to Bangladesh. Compare them to

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:16.440
Communist China. I also have a lot to say
in favor of Theravada Buddhist countries,

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:23.299
politically, socially, culturally and so on.
In many ways I was well-suited to be a kind

00:49:23.299 --> 00:49:30.099
of positive, uplifting advocate for this stuff.
I wasn't in a position of hostility to this

00:49:30.099 --> 00:49:40.910
field of studies. This brings us to point
3, why did I quit? If I put in all this time,

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:45.089
if I gained reading comprehension in the language,
if I put in all the hours to, as I mentioned,

00:49:45.089 --> 00:49:51.400
[develop] very good hand-writing, the ability
to not only read but write in the Burmese

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:59.369
tradition of Pali, the Thai, the Cambodian,
blah blah blah. [If] I put in all this time

00:49:59.369 --> 00:50:08.890
and effort, why would I quit? Well, you know,
I remember I got on the phone with somebody,

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:15.000
he was a PhD candidate at the time, I don't
know if he's now finished his PhD, and he

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.710
talked to me about altruism. He said to me,
"Well, your work must be motivated by altruism."

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:30.450
And I said, "No", and that shocked him. I
said, look, when I was working with a charity

00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:36.430
on the border between Laos and Myanmar, and
that charity's raison d'etre was to hand out

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:45.869
sacks of rice to starving people, that's altruism.
Let's not mess around. Altruism exists in

00:50:45.869 --> 00:50:54.809
this world. On the border between Thailand
and Laos there is an orphanage to help babies

00:50:54.809 --> 00:51:04.049
born with H.I.V./A.I.D.S. who have been abandoned
by their own parents. It's run by Christians,

00:51:04.049 --> 00:51:11.470
not by Buddhists. It's controlled by Christian
missionaries. That's altruism. I used to talk

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:16.119
to Buddhists about it, and say, "How can you
leave this for Christian missionaries to do?

00:51:16.119 --> 00:51:21.520
C'mon, these are your orphans, these are your…
you've got to organize a Buddhist alternative."

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:26.599
No no, [they would reply,] "Leave it for the
Christians", "bad karma", "if those babies

00:51:26.599 --> 00:51:32.660
were born with a disability, we don't wanna
know because that's bad karma". This is the

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:39.039
stuff you deal with, if you really are out
there in the field, this is what you deal

00:51:39.039 --> 00:51:48.029
with in Buddhism today. That's altruism, those
two charities I mentioned as examples are

00:51:48.029 --> 00:51:54.630
altruism. What am I looking for? For me as
a scholar? For me as an independent intellectual?

00:51:54.630 --> 00:52:00.319
As someone who is definitely not making money
out of Pali, out of Theravada Buddhism, out

00:52:00.319 --> 00:52:10.529
of this language, out of these histories,
cultures, peoples, it's still not altruism.

00:52:10.529 --> 00:52:18.279
If you put in this time and this work, what
you want back is an intellectual reward, not

00:52:18.279 --> 00:52:23.599
a financial reward, but that intellectual
reward is still tremendously important. And

00:52:23.599 --> 00:52:30.069
your motives, if you're honest with yourself,
are not altruistic. If you take the time to

00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:36.190
write an academic book-review (you don't need
a PhD to do that, if you're still a student,

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:44.230
you can start writing book-reviews now), what's
motivating you? It shouldn't be an animus

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:49.210
toward the author of the original book, it
shouldn't be to try to score points by showing

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:52.940
that you're smarter than the book you're reviewing,
it shouldn't be anything like that. If you're

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:59.210
going to review a book that's out there, it
is because you want to be part of an intellectual

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:06.279
tradition, a discourse, a dialogue. You want
to be involved in discussing those issues,

00:53:06.279 --> 00:53:09.849
and who do you want to discuss them with?
You want to discuss them with other people

00:53:09.849 --> 00:53:16.829
whose opinions you respect. If you put in
the hard work to really learn Pali, to become

00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:21.349
a Pali scholar, etc., and let's say you go
to that same conference I described earlier

00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:30.390
where I met Richard Gombrich for the first
time: why are you going there? It's not altruism.

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:34.849
You're not going there to make money, either.
You're not going there on an ego trip, but

00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:41.670
you're going because you hope to be part of
an intellectual tradition of some kind. [It

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:46.010
could be] a brand new intellectual tradition.
It doesn't have to be an intellectual tradition

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:52.400
that stretches back to more-than-2,500-years-ago
in ancient India. It can be a brand new intellectual

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:57.819
tradition, but you want to be discussing these
issues with other people who care about them,

00:53:57.819 --> 00:54:04.260
with other people who know about them, with
other people whose opinion you respect. So

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:09.630
that's not altruism. And, what I've just said,
I think if people are really honest with themselves,

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:17.760
in many different areas of intellectual endeavor,
they would agree, they would say the same

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.500
thing. If you ask someone who is a Marxist,
"What motivates you to do all this hard work

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:28.160
about Marxism?", I'm sure many of them would
say it is because they want to be part of

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:32.740
this intellectual tradition, they want to
engage with other people they respect, and

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:42.920
so on. After so many years of being involved
with Pali, with Theravada Buddhism, after

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:48.039
doing everything I wanted to do, and many
things I never dreamed I would do… Look,

00:54:48.039 --> 00:54:53.750
I never dreamed I would have the experience
of waking up on the Mekong River. I never

00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:59.960
dreamed that the Mekong River would go from
being this tremendously distant, exotic place

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:05.390
to being a mode of transport for me, taking
these small wooden boats up and down the Mekong

00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:11.380
river. I never thought I'd meet Bhikkhu Bodhi
in his current location in the United States.

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:15.960
I never thought I would sleep under the same
roof where Bhikkhu Bodhi used to live, where

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:21.000
he became famous, the forest hermitage in
Sri Lanka. I never thought I'd see any of

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.180
that stuff, I never thought I'd do that stuff,
I never thought I'd meet those people. I never

00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:29.859
thought I'd be able to see the kind of ancient
artifacts I saw… wonderful. I'd done it

00:55:29.859 --> 00:55:38.220
all, but what was missing was exactly this
question of an intellectual tradition, of

00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:43.789
having colleagues you respect. And, again,
you know, I've mentioned that within Western

00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:47.339
academia there were all kinds of people who
appreciated my work, and who were positive

00:55:47.339 --> 00:55:55.660
and encouraged me… because I mentioned Stanford
by name, I'll use that as the example. You

00:55:55.660 --> 00:56:01.160
know, Stanford, they said, "Yeah, okay, you
can come here and get a PhD", and there are

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:08.480
details, obviously, about how the application
goes, blah blah blah, but the reality was

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:14.990
that if I had gone to Stanford all of my colleagues
would have been Tibetan specialists. Tibetan

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:22.369
Buddhism, Tibetan language, Tibetan history.
That's not my tradition. I don't want to be

00:56:22.369 --> 00:56:28.339
a part of that. I don't want to talk about
that. I don't hate Tibet, but look at a map,

00:56:28.339 --> 00:56:37.079
Tibet and Thailand are remarkably far apart.
And, you know, there may be some wonderful

00:56:37.079 --> 00:56:45.380
scholars of Tibetan Buddhism, Tibetan History,
Tibetan Politics, at Stanford or at other

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:52.869
universities. I don't want anything to do
with that. You know, I've got to be honest

00:56:52.869 --> 00:57:00.490
with myself about that. After a number of
years not just being in the game but seeing

00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:06.859
so much directly, hands-on, visiting so many
universities in person (not just reading about

00:57:06.859 --> 00:57:11.650
them on the internet), and, you know, in terms
of reading, I wasn't just reading ancient

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:15.369
[texts], I was reading all the new academic
literature that comes out, there aren't that

00:57:15.369 --> 00:57:19.269
many decent journals, there's not that much
to read, sadly. But, you know, I started at

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:23.430
the University of Toronto that still had an
excellent library built up by A.K. Warder

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:28.549
(and I met A.K. Warder!), you know, these
guys left behind their books. After getting

00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:35.569
this incredibly thorough survey, I had to
admit to myself, there is no tradition today

00:57:35.569 --> 00:57:42.130
for me to be a part of, and I can't create
a tradition out of nothing. And I can't do

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:54.210
this totally alone. I'm a Canadian citizen.
Come back to Canada. Is there any way I can

00:57:54.210 --> 00:58:01.880
study Pali in Canada? Is there any way I can
study modern Burmese in Canada? Is there any

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:21.049
way I would be able to work on… Long story
short: no. I could have ended on a positive

00:58:21.049 --> 00:58:25.940
note, instead the positivity is at the beginning
of this video. So, if you want to cheer yourself

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:32.960
up, hit play again, go back to the start,
and hear how wonderful my life was as a Pali

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:40.049
scholar. Because there were a lot of wonderful
things about it. With nothing but a backpack,

00:58:40.049 --> 00:58:49.549
a bicycle, and a lot of hard work, I went
everywhere, I did everything, I lived my dream.

00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:54.609
When that dream was over, I had to look at
the reality of the tradition as it exists

00:58:54.609 --> 00:59:02.170
today and say, "I can't be a part of it".
Is that a happy ending or a sad ending? Can't

00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:03.119
it be both?
