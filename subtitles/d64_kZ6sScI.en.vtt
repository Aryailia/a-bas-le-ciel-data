his his skill level was so high I mean
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.870 align:start position:0%
his his skill level was so high I mean
this<00:01:22.110><c> is</c><00:01:22.290><c> one</c><00:01:22.560><c> of</c><00:01:22.680><c> the</c><00:01:22.740><c> tricks</c><00:01:23.009><c> he</c><00:01:23.130><c> did</c><00:01:23.310><c> he</c>

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
this is one of the tricks he did he
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.270 align:start position:0%
this is one of the tricks he did he
would<00:01:24.030><c> take</c><00:01:24.210><c> a</c><00:01:24.439><c> quarter</c><00:01:25.439><c> like</c><00:01:25.710><c> a</c><00:01:25.830><c> 20</c><00:01:26.070><c> and</c><00:01:26.189><c> he</c>

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
would take a quarter like a 20 and he
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.859 align:start position:0%
would take a quarter like a 20 and he
could<00:01:26.400><c> do</c><00:01:26.520><c> it</c><00:01:26.610><c> with</c><00:01:26.729><c> a</c><00:01:26.759><c> nickel</c><00:01:27.150><c> too</c><00:01:27.360><c> I</c><00:01:27.450><c> think</c>

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 align:start position:0%
could do it with a nickel too I think
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.749 align:start position:0%
could do it with a nickel too I think
so<00:01:28.200><c> a</c><00:01:28.229><c> five</c><00:01:28.500><c> century</c><00:01:28.770><c> and</c><00:01:28.950><c> he</c><00:01:29.040><c> would</c><00:01:29.159><c> flip</c><00:01:29.520><c> it</c>

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 align:start position:0%
so a five century and he would flip it
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.030 align:start position:0%
so a five century and he would flip it
up<00:01:29.970><c> and</c><00:01:30.420><c> he</c><00:01:31.020><c> could</c><00:01:31.170><c> get</c><00:01:31.290><c> it</c><00:01:31.409><c> to</c><00:01:31.530><c> land</c><00:01:31.740><c> on</c><00:01:31.979><c> the</c>

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
up and he could get it to land on the
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.670 align:start position:0%
up and he could get it to land on the
top<00:01:32.220><c> of</c><00:01:32.430><c> the</c><00:01:32.610><c> backboard</c><00:01:33.509><c> the</c><00:01:34.200><c> basketball</c>

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.350 align:start position:0%
top of the backboard the basketball
backboard<00:01:34.950><c> and</c><00:01:35.520><c> then</c><00:01:35.939><c> he</c><00:01:36.000><c> could</c><00:01:36.150><c> take</c><00:01:36.270><c> a</c>

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
backboard and then he could take a
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
backboard and then he could take a
second<00:01:36.810><c> coin</c><00:01:37.020><c> and</c><00:01:37.350><c> flip</c><00:01:37.650><c> it</c><00:01:37.680><c> and</c><00:01:37.860><c> hit</c><00:01:38.070><c> them</c><00:01:38.220><c> and</c>

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 align:start position:0%
second coin and flip it and hit them and
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.649 align:start position:0%
second coin and flip it and hit them and
knock<00:01:38.460><c> them</c><00:01:38.640><c> both</c><00:01:38.729><c> down</c><00:01:38.909><c> so</c><00:01:39.119><c> they</c><00:01:39.240><c> filled</c><00:01:39.540><c> out</c>

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 align:start position:0%
knock them both down so they filled out
 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.609 align:start position:0%
knock them both down so they filled out
so<00:01:40.409><c> this</c><00:01:40.860><c> is</c><00:01:41.009><c> a</c><00:01:41.040><c> lifetime</c><00:01:41.689><c> devoted</c><00:01:42.689><c> to</c><00:01:43.470><c> these</c>

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
so this is a lifetime devoted to these
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.340 align:start position:0%
so this is a lifetime devoted to these

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 align:start position:0%
like you know and but I mean simply he
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.389 align:start position:0%
like you know and but I mean simply he

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 align:start position:0%
assume it's a arrhythmia or something so
 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
assume it's a arrhythmia or something so
