my mind as well
is<00:12:30.720><c> basically</c><00:12:31.279><c> that</c>

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
is basically that
 

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.949 align:start position:0%
is basically that
it's<00:12:33.680><c> so</c><00:12:34.000><c> again</c><00:12:34.240><c> you're</c><00:12:34.399><c> kind</c><00:12:34.560><c> of</c><00:12:34.639><c> referring</c>

00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
it's so again you're kind of referring
 

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:36.870 align:start position:0%
it's so again you're kind of referring

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.590 align:start position:0%
to how addictive it is so it seems it

i<00:12:45.040><c> think</c><00:12:45.200><c> you</c><00:12:45.279><c> could</c><00:12:45.440><c> argue</c><00:12:45.839><c> either</c><00:12:46.160><c> way</c><00:12:46.320><c> with</c>

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
i think you could argue either way with
 

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.990 align:start position:0%
i think you could argue either way with
that<00:12:46.639><c> it's</c><00:12:46.800><c> just</c><00:12:46.959><c> certain</c><00:12:47.279><c> games</c><00:12:47.680><c> and</c><00:12:47.760><c> those</c>

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
a little more safe and then i think
 

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.990 align:start position:0%
a little more safe and then i think
other<00:12:51.040><c> people</c><00:12:51.200><c> could</c><00:12:51.360><c> argue</c><00:12:51.519><c> that</c><00:12:51.600><c> just</c><00:12:51.760><c> video</c>

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
