00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.379
…and this video from this guy was, objectively,
anti-semitic.

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:17.680
And I decided, y'know, I am not going to get
offended, I'm going to try to do something

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.790
positive.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.930
Being offended is a behavior.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:30.130
It's not an instinct and it's not a feeling
in the sense that the immediate sensation

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:38.550
of pain is just a feeling or, um, responding
in a negative way to the smell of bleach is

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.300
an unbidden, instinctual reaction.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:53.519
Although people seem to cultivate the illusion
that they take offense at things just as immediately

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.139
and unthinkingly as they have those kinds
of feelings and reactions.

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:03.640
Really, what we're doing as adults, in being
offended, is making a choice.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.850
We're consciously choosing to engage in a
behavior and in a kind of "social display",

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.180
anthropologically speaking.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.520
I think, for the most part, people get offended
to try to declare to the world who they are,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.600
what kind of person they are.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.560
As behaviors go, getting offended is really
pretty counterproductive.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.979
Complaining, I think, is meaningful, and complaining
can be constructive, and can change people's

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.430
lives for the better.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.820
And complaining can really share important
information (in a professional context, in

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.710
a personal context, in all kinds of contexts).

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.979
I think learning to complain in a way that
doesn't denigrate people or offend people

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.479
or create enemies needlessly, I think that's
really an important part of being an adult.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.670
It should be needless to say that the purpose
of this video is not to create drama.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.860
I actually had a positive experience recently…
this is going to sound a bit bizarre.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.440
I saw a video here on Youtube, created by
one of my fellow vegans, somebody who I only

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.480
know because he's also a vegan activist, [he]
talks about the philosophy and praxis of veganism.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.400
And this video from this guy was objectively
anti-semitic.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.300
And, y'know, I had a choice, 'cause like I
say, getting offended is not an instinct,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.520
it's not instant, it's not immediate, you
have a choice.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.230
And I decided, y'know, I am not going to get
offended, I'm going to try to do something

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.230
positive.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.360
And this guy, who I'm not going to name, but
this other Youtube creator, he actually wrote

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.730
to me about some of his other uploads, where
he was talking about First Nations.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.970
So, First Nations, Native Americans, indigenous
people.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.950
And those, also, in another way, kind of were
offensive, although his heart was in the right

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.290
place on the latter issue, um, y'know, he
was only trying to say things that were anti-colonialist

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.480
and anti-genocide and what-have-you.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.230
But still, y'know, it was a bit crass and
offensive.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.160
And again, I decided, look, I'm going to do
something positive.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.090
I'm not going to get offended.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.460
And I'm not going to tell this guy that I'm
offended, because that's just counterproductive.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.170
So I tried to address what I'd called the
form and content of the problem, and what

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.430
I perceived to be the problem is that this
guy, like most of us on Youtube, he gives

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.200
unscripted, spontaneous, rants.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.240
And that's what I do, in case you can't tell,
this video is completely unscripted, unrehearsed

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.000
and unprepared.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.600
So I wrote to the guy in response to his having
mentioned to me his recent comments on First

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.480
Nations, and this is what I said.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.660
Look, man, my opinion is worth next-to-nothing,
and the internet is a place where everyone

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.000
can live their dreams to a limited extent
(within digital walls, so to speak).

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.710
I think there are real limits to the stream-of-consciousness
format you've chosen (and that you use most

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.100
of the time, not all of the time, in your
self-defined genre of videos).

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.840
Stream-of-consciousness only works when you're
talking about things you're already deeply

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.750
familiar with (perhaps even things that you're
overly familiar with).

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.460
Most ordinary people can do a solid stream-of-consciousness
(stand-up comedy) routine on why they hate

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.220
their job, because it's something they often
think about, and know about, etc.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.950
Similar spontaneous, amorphous commentary
on the history of First Nations (Native Americans,

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.100
etc.) is not going to work out for you.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.712
With that being said, I'm not discouraging
you from talking about this stuff, but I think

00:05:08.712 --> 00:05:11.230
you need to check your head [to lapse into
rap slang from 1989] and think about the extent

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.180
to which you need to make changes in form
to reflect different types of content.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.780
You had a video recently where you veer into
anti-Semitic hysteria.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.540
I don't think you intended to, I don't think
you planned to, and I think that you might

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.570
have to watch the video pretty carefully to
figure out just how bad you make yourself

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.360
sound, given what you actually said in that
dialogue, i.e., how casually you claim that

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.200
a Jewish conspiracy is controlling the world,
etc.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.870
Some things you can rant about without preparation,
without structure, without a script, etc.,

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.080
because you know those things deeply.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.770
Other things are a stretch.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.460
You can stretch and you should stretch.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.380
Should you make a video about First Nations?

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.440
Sure, but it's a stretch.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.150
I think you couldn't really make such a video
(or podcast) just "off the cuff", in the way

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.780
that you rant about subjects you already know
overly-well.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.770
You could, however, watch a given documentary
(from APTN, for instance) and then film your

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.930
reactions/thoughts to that documentary.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.550
That's not exactly a ton of research, but
it is still a level of structure and preparation

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.639
above and beyond stream-of-consciousness improv.

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.240
I say this because most of my own videos are
improvised also (however, for me, complaining

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.510
about Sanskrit is something I can do off-the-cuff,
because I have more than 10 years of salient

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.850
experience, etc.).

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.919
I don't think you can reasonably expect to
react to major questions in world politics

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.530
in the same way that you react to Joe Rogan.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.130
[Joe Rogan is the name of a stand-up comedian,
and pretty much all of the vegans hate the

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.130
guy.]

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.699
[Coming back to this letter.]

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.310
And your recent anti-semitic remarks (that
you may not perceive as anti-semitic yourself)

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.420
are a good example of the type of tightrope
you end up walking if you tread into this

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.520
type of stuff heedlessly.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:12.880
That's my advice --and I realize (with all
due humility) that it was unasked for.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.310
That's the end of my message.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.540
And that humility is not phony.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.330
I think you really do need to be humble when
you're giving people advice they haven't asked

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.230
for, and when you're telling somebody something
they don't want to hear.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:35.410
In this case, I'm telling somebody, "Look,
you may not even be aware of it, but, you've

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:41.960
made comments that are objectively anti-Semitic,
and that other people (including other Jewish

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.180
people) are going to perceive as anti-Semitic
and react to negatively, and it's going to

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.979
have consequences for you.

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:52.670
But the whole tone of this is helpful.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.870
And it's trying to share helpful information.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.780
And the point is not that I'm offended.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:09.450
And again, I ask: as a behavior, what would
be the point of being offended?

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.010
The message I wrote to this guy, it has a
point.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.650
And it's also giving him the benefit of the
doubt.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:23.169
It is saying, "Look, I'm willing to assume
that your heart's in the right place, I'm

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:28.100
willing to assume that you don't really mean
to be anti-Semitic, you don't really mean

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.229
to be saying things that are kind of offensive
or insensitive about First Nations.

00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:37.089
Now, it's possible, [that] I could give him
the benefit of the doubt, and he could write

00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:45.210
back to me, and reveal that he's a member
of a crazy anti-Semitic cult or political

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:50.850
organization, and he could write back denouncing
me for being a part of a Jewish conspiracy.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.230
You know, you talk to people on the internet,
you talk to people face-to-face in real life:

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.160
you don't know what you're going to get.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:04.220
I've met people in formal, academic contexts
who believed in crazy, anti-Semitic hysteria

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.309
and conspiracy theories --that would be a
different video.

00:09:09.309 --> 00:09:14.249
The internet is dark, real life is even darker,
you can deal with all that stuff face-to-face.

00:09:14.249 --> 00:09:20.019
Um, but, you know, again, why be offended?

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:23.100
I chose to do something positive, to say something
positive.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.930
And in this case, the story has a happy ending.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.240
His reaction was really positive.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.100
He wrote back to me appreciatively, and he
said, "Look, you know, you really gave me

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.769
some things to think about, and I'm going
to have to look at that video again, and think

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:39.769
about it, and this is, y'know, useful… he
said it was basically useful for him to reconsider

00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:45.279
the way he's making videos, and the way he's
making political statements, and wading into

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:50.579
really difficult and dangerous political waters.

00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:55.389
Maybe without a lot of forethought and a lot
of consideration as to the consequences, y'know,

00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:58.550
for how people perceive him and otherwise.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.560
So that went great.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:07.709
That's a positive experience connected to
anti-Semitism, where I addressed something,

00:10:07.709 --> 00:10:11.579
and, y'know, some small good came out of it
in the world.

00:10:11.579 --> 00:10:19.519
Now, y'know, uh, I've had the opposite experience
many times, where people choose to get offended

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:30.499
at me, rather than communicate anything meaningful,
rather than even thinking through and talking

00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:34.079
about what it is they're offended by.

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:38.839
I think one of the tragedies of the internet,
and what it's done to western culture, is

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:45.490
that it has rewarded people for the behavior
of making a display of their own moral superiority.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.119
And the point of this message that I just
read you is not to say, "I'm morally superior

00:10:49.119 --> 00:10:53.350
to you because you're anti-Semitic and I'm
not"; the point was not to say, "I'm morally

00:10:53.350 --> 00:11:00.050
superior to you because I have formal education
on First Nations' issues and I'm better-informed

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:05.230
and better-read about First Nations' politics,
and therefore what you said is crass and offensive,

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.610
and what I say is terribly refined and sophisticated".

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:14.850
None of that, because that would not serve
a purpose, that would be self-defeating (and

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.929
so on).

00:11:15.929 --> 00:11:20.550
And also, again, it's not false humility:
there's a level on which I don't really believe

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:26.730
it, just in the sense that, look, I mean,
everything I know, although learning it was

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:31.480
hard work, other people can learn, too, in
a pretty short span of time, if they do similar

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:37.689
hard work, and I encourage people to do that
kind of hard work.

00:11:37.689 --> 00:11:40.180
Right, man, I'm going to end it there.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:50.490
I just think we all need to really think about
what it means to be offended, why we do it,

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:58.029
what the objective is, and, um, in terms of
broadcasting on the internet, what's the audience

00:11:58.029 --> 00:11:59.940
for that?

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.180
What's the positive outcome supposed to be?
