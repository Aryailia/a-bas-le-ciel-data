00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.570
Why am I not a Buddhist?
Um, for some of you the question might be,

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:23.939
uh, why was I ever a Buddhist? Or, why would
I now say that I'm an ex-Buddhist, as opposed

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.460
to saying that I never was a Buddhist.
Um, I was involved with Buddhist studies (Buddhist-related

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.860
research) for 12 years of my life, a big percentage
of my adult life.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.860
And, uh, to start with a parable, I guess,
I remember hearing on the radio, in Canada,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.210
many years ago, about 15 years ago, a complaint
from a Christian minister about the derision

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.469
and contempt he was regarded with in Canada,
just as he went grocery shopping and went

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.950
about his daily business.
At that time there were scandals in the newspapers

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.950
about both Catholic and Protestant priests
and ministers and so on, and I remember that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.450
he specifically said that he couldn't smile
at or wave at a child without people looking

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.450
at him shrewishly or asking, "What's that
guy's problem?", or this kind of thing.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.200
Now, y'know, that minister, from his perspective,
when he puts on a uniform, he expects to get

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:46.439
more reverence, more respect, than some stranger
you know nothing about. He thinks he's clothing

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.430
himself in something that raises his status,
and I would guess many medical doctors have

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.430
the same expectation when they put on a lab
coat with a name-tag, and many other professions

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.210
as well, even though we know, rationally,
that a medical doctor can be a terrible person,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.210
obviously a priest can be a terrible person,
and so on. But it doesn't enter into the priest's

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.680
mind that when you live in a country where
the vast majority of people are not Christian

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:28.829
you're clothing yourself in the legacy of
genocide, slavery, racism within the church,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.109
and, of course, recent sexual abuse scandals.
You're clothing yourself in something that's

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:44.109
odious and that's only justified by, y'know,
an appeal to supernatural things that fewer

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.010
and fewer people now believe in.
However, the other meditation that comes out

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.010
of that is the fact that many people who (when
they meet that priest) are apprehensive or

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.130
suspicious, who don't have a positive response
to seeing the man in uniform, many of those

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:14.130
people still have a positive idea of Christianity,
still have some kind of religious connection

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.510
to, uh, an abstract god or still pray or still
want to believe in something.

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:30.919
Y'know, with Buddhism, I had to recognize
at a certain point that when I met someone

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.220
who was a Buddhist monk, I didn't assume good
things about them anymore. On the contrary,

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.750
I'd had so much experience that, um, when
I met someone who was wearing the robes, instead

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:55.169
[I'd] have apprehensions and very negative
expectations, and [I] would wonder, y'know,

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.260
"What's his story?"
Once in a while you meet a monk and you find

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.509
out who they are and you find out there are
some thing you can respect about them, however,

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:12.509
when you know the state of Buddhist monasticism
in the 21st century you know that if you meet

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.530
a complete stranger on the street, dressed
in a nondescript way, you may expect the best,

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.400
you may expect the worst, you have no expectations
either way, compared to the rest of humanity;

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.400
but when you meet someone who is a Buddhist
monk, what they're clothed in (for me, as

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.930
someone who became an expert on Buddhism,
in 12 years) is actually very negative. So,

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.930
as soon as I could recognize that, y'know,
not only is it the case that I'm not a Buddhist,

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.260
but that I don't want to be a Buddhist, I
don't want to be called or referred to as

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.990
a Buddhist. Uh, you can look up an interview
I gave to a magazine in Hong Kong (a Buddhist

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.930
magazine) in which I do refer to myself as
a Buddhist, I'll provide the link at the bottom

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.180
of this youtube video; so I have called myself
a Buddhist in the past, and I can remember

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.540
other people trying to denounce me by claiming
that I was not a Buddhist, and I would be

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.100
able to turn around and say, "Look, this is
what I've accomplished in the past years,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.830
this is what I've devoted my life to, what
grounds do you have for saying I'm not a Buddhist?"

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.660
Very often the people saying this [to me],
they themselves had no scholarly knowledge

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.980
of Buddhism, they had not done anything, they
had not accomplished anything in their lives,

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:41.300
that proved any kind of commitment to (or
interest in) the religion.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.450
Now, [within] Buddhism, perhaps more than
some [other] religions, it is entirely possible

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:54.450
to be a Buddhist and not believe in anything
supernatural. It is true [that] I never believed

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.520
in magic, I never believed that when you die
you went to meet King Yama in hell --and it's

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.690
the same King Yama in the Pali canon that
you see in the modern cartoon Dragon Ball

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:16.250
Z. It's the same mythology; different artists
have interpreted it in different ways, of

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.210
course, over the centuries.
No, uh, in that sense, I never did [believe],

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.650
but what I believe in that was more compelling
to me was that my engagement with Buddhism

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:33.350
was part of me making a positive difference
in the world, and I'd like to think that's

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:40.350
what motivated someone to be a scholar of
Socrates or Thucydides, or any other ancient

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:48.889
philosopher, that may not be considered religious
today, or that may be a religious philosopher.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.770
And what made Theravada Buddhism so dynamic
was the mix of humanitarian work and field

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:03.710
research that it offered me, that there was
the modern disaster of places like Cambodia

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:10.710
and Laos, the intersection of political and
philosophical concerns, ancient history and

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:20.210
modern history, and indeed ancient languages
and modern languages, all mixed up at the

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:26.110
same point.
But there's a very sad sequel to the first

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.669
image I used, that when I meet a Buddhist
monk I don't consider them a good person,

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:36.040
I don't have positive expectations, that I'm
apprehensive, knowing what I know, and many

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:43.040
other Buddhists, sadly, are the same way;
and that is that in 12 years, I met many of

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.930
the leading figures in the field face-to-face,
and there are many others whose work I've

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:54.930
read and who talked to me by e-mail, this
being the 21st century, and, um, there's not

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:02.250
a single scholar in the game that I respect.
Not even one. And, uh, the level of intellectual

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:08.720
dishonesty and fraud --outright fraud-- that
exists in the academic study of Buddhism,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:15.310
that was something that continued to disappoint
me, no matter how low my expectations were.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:22.310
So, uh, y'know, when I say now that I'm an
ex-Buddhist, that's because in the past, even

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:30.870
though I didn't believe in magic, I did commit
my life (I thought I would spend the rest

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:36.919
of my life) [to] working on Pali and its connection
to modern Southeast Asian languages (including

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:43.919
Lao, Cambodian, etc.) and I thought I would
dedicate my life partly to dragging some of

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.140
the most interesting philosophy out of those
ancient texts and making it available to the

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:57.140
public, and also being involved in (and I
was involved in) the humanitarian concerns

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:05.420
as those countries variously emerged from
post-war, post-communist disasters, and undergo

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:12.420
a period of cultural and economic transformation.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:32.240
(Silence.)

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:46.340
 The positive side of the story is that I did
accomplish, really, everything I wanted to

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:52.940
accomplish. I was able to live in those countries
for a number of years, I was able to work

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.700
on those languages, I was able to teach myself
Pali to a level where I could really read

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:04.700
philosophy in the original source, and I had
a diverse and very educational experience

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:10.610
during those years. A very very hard life
financially and materially, I coped with very

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:17.610
tough circumstances, but when people ask me
(and they do sometimes ask me), "Why don't

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.180
you go back to Cambodia now?", "Why don't
you continue your work in these places?",

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:28.180
one reason is that I've done just about everything
I set out to do. That's the positive reason.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:34.120
And the negative reason is what I've already
mentioned, that there's really no further

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:41.120
I can go with it, because of the absence of
any colleagues that I respect, the absence

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:48.860
of any institutions I respect. And I get fan-mail
all the time, still today I get fan-mail (I

00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:53.899
got more in the past when I was more active
on the internet), and normally the first question

00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:58.899
people wanna ask is, "Wow, this is great,
give me your recommended reading list, whose

00:10:58.899 --> 00:11:04.870
book should I read?" "What's the best place
to study?" "What are the best institutions?"

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:10.260
And, um, y'know, in terms of living authors
and so on, there's really nothing I can recommend,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:15.490
and instead, y'know, when people write back
to me with enthusiasm about some book, I have

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:20.220
to say, "No, I'm sorry to warn you, but this
translator is intentionally misleading in

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:25.990
these ways, this author is misleading in these
ways," it's really reached a remarkably low

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:32.990
ebb in 2014.
So, y'know, that's the negative side of it.

00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:38.279
I've been all over the world with this Buddhist
thing.

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:43.050
I spoke once with a monk who I have some respect
for, to give a positive example of a monk;

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:50.050
he was a guy who was dragged out of one country
after another as a refugee, and, uh, his temple

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.050
was burned down by muslims, he was attacked
and beaten by muslims, his followers were

00:11:54.050 --> 00:12:00.010
too, he was a victim of anti-Buddhist muslim
violence, which is a huge issue that you can't

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.029
read about much in the mainstream press, but
that's the story of a thousand years that's

00:12:04.029 --> 00:12:11.029
still ongoing today. And, um, I remember he
and I had a long conversation, he was very

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.029
honest with me (many monks are, because, as
a man with a shaved head, who can really read

00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:23.029
Pali, and who knew the text, I had a kind
of intermediary status, half-way between monk

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.040
and layperson), a lot of them were very honest
with me… and, um, at the end of the conversation,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.430
he sort of turned off the honesty it seemed
to me, and for a second just said, "Well,

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.870
you know, everything in Buddhism is getting
better and better now."

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:44.830
"It's flourishing here in the west, it's flourishing
in various countries in Asia…", and that

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.790
was such a striking contrast to the conversation
he and I had been having up until that moment,

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:55.420
[when] we were both talking about our experiences
in Southeast Asia and around the world. I

00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:01.300
just said to him, I'm sorry, but I don't believe
you; I don't think even you believe that.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:08.300
I think you know that Buddhism is collapsing
in China, Buddhism is collapsing in Tibet,

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:15.740
Buddhism is collapsing in Sri Lanka, Buddhism
is collapsing in Thailand, and so on.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.570
And in the western world there's much less
legitimate scholarship of Buddhism going on

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:32.170
now than there was 100 years ago, virtually
zero, and there's certainly zero legitimate

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:39.300
religious or monastic Buddhism in the west.
There's a lot of fraud, a lot of scams, but,

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.110
um, nothing to hold up as a positive…
