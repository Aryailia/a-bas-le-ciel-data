00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.870
My reason for creating this youtube channel
is that I have a daughter, and I have a daughter

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.920
that I will never get to see again.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.770
So, you can imagine, I'm creating these videos
with the hope that one day my daughter will

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.749
have the opportunity to see them.

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:22.750
One day this will create an opportunity for
her to know what I sounded like, what I looked

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.230
like, what motivated me in life, what the
reasons were for how I lived my life up to

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.230
this point.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.180
And, of course, I'm hoping that Youtube will
still be in business 20 years from now.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.430
If the website disappears, then my efforts
to leave some bridge between the generations

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.700
will disappear with it.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.200
In all of these photographs, you'll notice
that I look exhausted.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.520
And I am exhausted.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.030
Taking care of a newborn baby is basically
impossible for two people to do in isolation;

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.170
I don't particularly subscribe to the old
saying that "it takes a village to raise a

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.070
child", but there's a huge difference between
two parents working alone, and two parents

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.170
having help from a third person or a fourth
person (whether that's a grandparent, an aunt,

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.729
an uncle, or otherwise).

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.120
The more people you have, the more you can
distribute the hours of sleep between the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.490
adults.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.789
We had just two people, working very much
alone.

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.959
In presenting these photographs, I could be
telling stories about the circumstances surrounding

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.880
the birth, what we went through before and
after.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.829
I could talk about how awful the staff were
at the hospital; I could talk about how awful

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.340
the struggle was to get furniture and electricity
into the apartment before the baby arrived.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:50.789
However, most of those stories, they're neither
concise nor witty; they'd probably take several

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:57.329
hours to tell, and I think they might not
even be interesting to my own daughter.

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.329
It was tough.

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:05.529
In a word, the whole process was tough, and
nobody made it easy for us.

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:11.140
People in the medical system lied to us at
every stage.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.090
People lost their tempers all around us for
no good reason at all.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:24.960
I had to stop --physically stop-- a nurse
from attacking my wife at least once or twice.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.010
Everyone who was supposed to be healthy, sane
professional, acted like they were the ones

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.000
who needed help.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.531
They were openly bullying someone who was
in physical pain, to no good purpose, and

00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:46.930
created conflict and misery on what should
have been (or could have been) a happy occasion.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.270
Instead, all the time that we were in contact
with medical professionals was just a bleak

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.160
struggle.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:04.420
And, I was told many times that if I didn't
like it, I could go back to the health care

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.520
system in "my country" â€”and the people telling
me this, they all imagined that I came from

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.150
some third-world country that lacked electricity,
that lacked modern hospitals, no matter how

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.743
many times I told them that I was from Canada.

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:25.930
I had sacrificed everything in my life to
relocate from Asia to Canada, to start a new

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.480
life, supporting my wife, in the new job that
she had accepted there.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.900
And then, just as suddenly, I had to sacrifice
everything I was doing in Canada, to start

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.150
a new life in France, and support my wife's
decision to quit her job and have a baby at

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.980
the same time.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.250
France didn't last; the marriage didn't last,
either.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.480
I was able to spend only 10 months with my
daughter before my wife's sudden disappearance,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.950
taking both the baby, and, predictably, taking
all of our money with her.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.900
She was on an airplane just four days after
the decision to divorce.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.880
However, during those first ten months of
my daughter's life, all of my time was devoted

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.940
to taking care of the baby, either directly
or indirectly.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.880
When you have just two people working in isolation,
you have to carefully coordinate everything

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.180
you're doing, from grocery shopping to napping,
so that someone is tending to the baby at

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.540
all times.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.340
And, during that process, I was also doing
a lot of heavy lifting, as moved, again and

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.720
again, from one home to the next, bought new
furniture, assembled the furniture, and then

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.150
ended up throwing it away.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:52.290
The struggle was to create an island of stability
for a newborn baby, in a context where our

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.970
own lives, in fact, were completely lacking
any stability.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.180
What was going to happen with my own future
(even within a few months' time) was very

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.810
much an open question.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:14.440
So, now, I'll never see my daughter again,
and I'm left to start a new life on my own.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:24.240
I know that you may be wondering, with some
idiom or another, "How is this possible?"

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.520
If two educated people get together... if
get married to a woman with a PhD, how does

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.720
it end this way?

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.840
How do you end up as a guest on the Jerry
Springer show?

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.540
Intellectuals are passionate people too.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.120
Most intellectuals I've known were motivated
by their passions more than their thoughts,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.030
maybe just because they've long since gotten
bored of their thoughts in their teenage years.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.590
When we first met, my wife fell in love with
me pretty much instantly.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.790
She made the decision that she wanted to marry
me about three weeks into the relationship.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:08.310
Less than six years later, she was just as
decisive in leaving me â€”and, whatever mix

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.900
of motivations she may have had, that isn't
my story to tell.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.610
On this Youtube channel, I'm just telling
my own story, about my own past, present and

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.610
future.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.169
And, hopefully, as I say, one day my daughter
will be able to see this and hear this, and

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.370
make better decisions for her own life.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:38.500
In the 21st century, ultimately, it is entirely
my wife's decision, and of course, as terrible

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.180
as it is for me, I sympathize that she's made
a very tough decision, and [has] chosen a

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.500
very hard path, in choosing to be a single
mother.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.760
And I'm left to say that (in some sense) I
support her decision, even if it has a devastating

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.000
effect on my own life, just as I supported
her other decisions before, relocating to

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.889
Canada, relocating to France, relocating to
Asia, I supported those decisions also, even

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:05.680
if they had a devastating effect on my life.
