french<00:08:05.280><c> revolution</c><00:08:05.759><c> is</c><00:08:06.000><c> is</c><00:08:06.080><c> an</c><00:08:06.240><c> example</c><00:08:06.560><c> of</c>

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
french revolution is is an example of
 

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:07.189 align:start position:0%
french revolution is is an example of
that

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
that
 

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.270 align:start position:0%
that
because<00:08:07.440><c> what</c><00:08:07.599><c> happens</c><00:08:07.919><c> is</c><00:08:08.000><c> that</c><00:08:08.160><c> napoleon</c><00:08:09.039><c> uh</c>

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
because what happens is that napoleon uh
 

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.749 align:start position:0%
because what happens is that napoleon uh
ends<00:08:10.080><c> he</c><00:08:10.319><c> ends</c><00:08:10.560><c> the</c><00:08:10.639><c> revolution</c><00:08:11.199><c> basically</c><00:08:11.599><c> he</c>

00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
ends he ends the revolution basically he
 

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.350 align:start position:0%
ends he ends the revolution basically he
subverts<00:08:12.160><c> the</c><00:08:12.319><c> revolution</c>

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
subverts the revolution
 

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.110 align:start position:0%
subverts the revolution
so<00:08:13.599><c> yeah</c><00:08:13.919><c> no</c><00:08:14.240><c> i</c><00:08:14.319><c> think</c><00:08:14.560><c> i</c><00:08:14.639><c> think</c><00:08:14.879><c> even</c><00:08:15.039><c> the</c>

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah no i think i think even the
 

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.390 align:start position:0%
so yeah no i think i think even the
french<00:08:15.360><c> revolution</c><00:08:15.919><c> is</c>

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.070 align:start position:0%
french revolution is
is<00:08:16.560><c> an</c><00:08:16.720><c> example</c><00:08:17.039><c> of</c><00:08:17.199><c> that</c><00:08:17.360><c> where</c><00:08:17.520><c> it</c><00:08:17.599><c> didn't</c><00:08:17.919><c> it</c>

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
is an example of that where it didn't it
 

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.510 align:start position:0%
is an example of that where it didn't it
didn't<00:08:18.319><c> go</c><00:08:18.479><c> all</c><00:08:18.639><c> the</c><00:08:18.720><c> way</c>

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.629 align:start position:0%
didn't go all the way
um<00:08:19.840><c> once</c><00:08:20.080><c> napoleon</c><00:08:20.720><c> takes</c><00:08:21.039><c> over</c><00:08:22.240><c> he</c><00:08:22.400><c> gives</c>

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
i would say that the standard reading is
 

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.829 align:start position:0%
i would say that the standard reading is
that<00:08:42.159><c> the</c><00:08:42.320><c> revolution</c><00:08:42.959><c> was</c><00:08:43.120><c> followed</c><00:08:43.519><c> by</c><00:08:43.680><c> a</c>

um<00:08:47.040><c> but</c><00:08:47.200><c> that</c><00:08:47.440><c> counter-revolution</c>

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
um but that counter-revolution
 

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.070 align:start position:0%
um but that counter-revolution
incorporated<00:08:49.120><c> some</c><00:08:49.279><c> of</c><00:08:49.360><c> the</c><00:08:49.519><c> elements</c><00:08:49.920><c> some</c>

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
incorporated some of the elements some
