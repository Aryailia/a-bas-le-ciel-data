00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.810 align:start position:0%
really prepared for the scenario what if
the<00:20:40.060><c> United</c><00:20:40.210><c> States</c><00:20:40.600><c> loses</c><00:20:41.560><c> and</c><00:20:41.830><c> leaves</c><00:20:42.430><c> and</c>

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:42.820 align:start position:0%
the United States loses and leaves and
 

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
the United States loses and leaves and
so<00:20:43.330><c> we're</c><00:20:43.510><c> still</c><00:20:43.780><c> at</c><00:20:43.960><c> this</c><00:20:44.110><c> first</c><00:20:44.500><c> step</c><00:20:45.130><c> of</c>

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:45.370 align:start position:0%
so we're still at this first step of
 

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.990 align:start position:0%
so we're still at this first step of
asking<00:20:46.210><c> this</c><00:20:46.360><c> question</c><00:20:47.040><c> what</c><00:20:48.040><c> happens</c><00:20:48.460><c> next</c>

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.000 align:start position:0%

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:51.850 align:start position:0%
what happens now not when the Taliban
 

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%

00:20:58.170 --> 00:20:58.180 align:start position:0%
they have against all odds against a one
 

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.750 align:start position:0%
they have against all odds against a one
