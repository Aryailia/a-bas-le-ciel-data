00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:17.320
a bas le ciel
politics is one of 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.589
those rare topics where we deal with theoretical
abstract philosophical questions in a way

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.279
that really matters in the real world it matters
on a large scale in terms of the future of

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.760
our society ecology the environment what have
you but it also matters in our personal lives

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.630
in a practical sense in terms of everyday
conversations we have everyday conflicts we

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.480
have real world situations we have to negotiate
with have to figure out a way out of of course

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.590
not too many there not too many topics under
the heading of political philosophy where

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.309
I could say that's true use a really down-to-earth
example kick off this video you may or may

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.519
not have been in the situation as a vegan
face to face with a meat-eater or over the

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.800
Internet some kind of chatroom discussion
where the meat-eater is saying to you with

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.570
exasperation look this is just about food
like where the meteor says to you how can

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.430
you waste my time with these questions when
all you're talking about is food all right

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.409
so from the meteors perspective there's an
implicit contrast here between really important

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.619
social and political questions like why is
the United States bombing Iraq the progress

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.479
of the war in Mosul and this kind of thing
and this category of merely personal preferences

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.540
dietary choices and questions of personal
purity so from the meteors perspective in

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.189
this case not always once in a while you have
this scenario from the meteors perspective

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:52.750
the vegan diet is as ethically absurd as the
kosher diet because they're both ultimately

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.659
just questions a diet it's just talking about
food and on a deeper level it's just talking

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.950
about personal purity so the meteor is saying
to you look I have some tolerance for hearing

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.690
you people talk about a kosher diet or Hindu
diet or a Buddhist diet but bottom line to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.040
me it's all food and there's some other category
of real philosophy real politics real social

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.319
problems and that's what I want to talk about
whether it's the bombing of Mosul what what

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.510
is going on in the war in Iraq or maybe labor
unions protesting for higher wages raising

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.069
the minimum wage in the United States whatever
set of examples they happen to care about

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.730
or be engaged in now I said many times in
this channel sympathy is especially important

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.250
as an analytical tool I think it's worthwhile
for vegans to sympathize the other side and

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.771
understand why they perceive us that way while
they perceive us as people that way and why

00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:52.670
they perceive the problems that veganism is
trying to engage with and address in that

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.540
way and there's no doubt that to some extent
meat eaters perceive our movement that way

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.930
because some members of our movement have
been actively packaging and promoting veganism

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.610
just as a lifestyle just as a plant-based
lose weight feel great have fewer heart attacks

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.210
have lower cholesterol you know this this
kind of thing and then a step beyond that

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:23.510
there are definitely vegans who package veganism
in pseudo spiritual terms where it does indeed

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.260
start to resemble a kosher diet it starts
to resemble a Hindu diet a purity based mentality

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.120
yeah now a step further beyond that and definitely
impacting more vegans although some vegans

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.430
consciously and intentionally speak in terms
of personal purity purification detoxing etc

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.230
I think there's a larger number of vegans
who think about the significance and importance

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.829
of the diet in terms of their identity and
we're in an unexamined way the issue of identity

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.510
the identity politics of being veganism really
is about purity here's an example that right

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.599
now is controversial there are some vegans
who go around arguing primarily to other vegans

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.730
which is of course hilarious in itself right
like this is this isn't outreach this isn't

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.730
trying to spread veganism this is really an
internal issue within because vegans who argue

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:25.080
that you're not really vegan if you eat almonds
that you're not really vegan if you eat blueberries

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.480
well of course of horse almonds are vegan
of course blueberries a vegan what's the argument

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.920
here the argument is that some crops in the
United States rely so heavily on honeybees

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.880
that really economically the production of
almonds in the production of blueberries should

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.760
be regarded as one stage in the cycle of profitable
production of honey and honey from honeybees

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.260
is not vegan and in the same sense that we
look at the production of cow milk as being

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.390
one stage in the same cycle of production
that produces leather and veal and of course

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.420
cow meat so on and so forth that's one industry
with several different stages of production

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.140
yeah now these people they may be very sincere
they may be very sincere and telling you that

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.330
you're not really vegan because you drink
almond milk they may not be doing this in

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.390
a cynical sense at all they may not be doing
this in a spiritual sense at all they may

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.980
not use the language of personal purity you
know they may use the language of ecology

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.800
of moral responsibility of being accountable
for the you know indirect ecological consequences

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.950
of your consumer choices they may present
this in a completely down-to-earth way but

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:46.030
my assertion here is that the underlying problem
actually is a problem of thinking of veganism

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.260
in terms of personal purity that because this
is my conceptual way of explaining people

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.870
you're looking at the human being as a dot
on a diagram the one person as a consumer

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.020
you're thinking of the vegan diet as a boycott
and then you're thinking of a circle drawn

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.960
around that point you know a circle drawn
around the point the diagram of how much ecological

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.270
impact that person makes and then the quest
to be more and more pure to more and more

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.800
curtail and reduce your the ecological impacts
or ethical negative negative ethical impacts

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.940
of your diet so thus with that mentality whether
or not it's expressed in terms of purity the

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.340
issue of almonds becomes a big deal they should
house paint a lot of paint and glue products

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:36.930
are non vegan by the way car tires blueberries
these things come to the fore because the

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.700
issue is are you vegan an are you living up
to this title that defines personal purity

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:48.100
and moral goodness and are you doing everything
you can to shrink down the ecological and

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.010
negative ethical impacts of your consumer
choices of your diet their choices.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.400
So there are vegans who say to me really seriously
they don't believe in buying furniture or

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:02.340
they will only buy furniture if it is made
out of recycled garbage repurposed materials

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.690
not new wood because wood cuts down trees
and this harms the environment and so on with

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.560
this this has been carried on as a quest for
personal purity

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.410
Now it's really interesting, I got an email
just the other day I think just yesterday

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.570
from mod vegan mod vegan and I agree about
a lot of issues my vegans another youtuber

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.360
here aspiring vegan activist aspiring thinking
organizer and my vegan I have a lot in common

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.490
lately I've had a few videos disagreeing with
her on specific issues and I make those videos

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.300
because then they're interesting and worthwhile
points of disagreement but you gotta realize

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.780
my vegan that we agree about a lot and just
about two weeks ago she and I did a Skype

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.640
call so we did a face-to-face conversation
with Internet that lasted fully two hours

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.660
I know that because for me the phone call
started at midnight and I hung up at 2 a.m.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.540
so it was up real late talking to ModVegan
that night.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.570
You know and there was a whole constellation
of issues we agree about and I could make

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:56.010
a bunch of videos now talking about some of
those interesting just really summarizing

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:00.730
some of things that came up in that conversation
to us where you know we were both really a

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.030
part of it down to earth questions about how
we're actually gonna organize vegan movements

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.980
in Canada in the next 10 years like really
practical questions about what are we doing

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.271
next terms of getting organized in veganism
and some of the more more theoretical and

00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:17.340
abstract issues but on the points here I you
know I do agree with mod vegan on a huge range

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.160
of issues across the board.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.680
hHowever, I was really surprised when yesterday
I got an email from Maude and she was saying

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:32.010
to me that she considered me to be in the
pro purity camp this purity based approach

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:39.080
to veganism in contrast to pragmatists I suppose
a pragmatist a camp in which she would include

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.090
someone like Peter Singer and Tobias Leonar
we've got to get back to doing a book review

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:49.000
of Tobias lean arts book by the way we did
its kind of part one but we me and my girlfriend

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.890
we will reiden review the rest of the book
so those are interesting kind of dissident

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.550
voices in the vegan movement today Peter Singer
Tobias later on

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.560
so that really surprised me and I wrote back
to her saying well you know it's been a long

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.320
time since I addressed the purity issue but
quite a few videos and a couple of podcasts

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.010
I did patreon exclusive podcast really talked
about this at length and I listed off all

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:16.110
these reasons why I feel I'm not in the purity
camp if anything I'm kind of an aunty purity

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.240
vegan.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.690
For me I think there's a there's a misconception
here look what is the problem in practice

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:23.810
with this purity mentality?

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:35.680
okay are you willing to cooperate with hunters
an association like Ducks Unlimited that hunts

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.920
ducks are you willing to associate with a
group that openly engages in fur trapping

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.860
bear shooting bears if as a vegan you start
a charity and do a conservation based project

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:55.690
where the outcomes you're pursuing our biodiversity
saving a certain plot of land saving a certain

00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:00.550
forest this kind of saving a certain river
let's say a certain watershed are you willing

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:05.860
to cooperate and collaborate with groups that
eat meat and that may be actively engage in

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:15.330
in hunting okay from my perspective the answer
is in principle yes in practice maybe.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.770
So then email I gave an example I said well
I could collaborate with hunters I'm actually

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.760
soft on that issue because although I take
the definition of veganism very seriously,

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.700
so I mean I don't think I'm a purist, I don’t
think it’s about purity, but I say well

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.420
look, this is the definition of veganism,
it's not flexible either you're vegan or you're

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:36.640
not, I'm willing to say okay I'm vegan they're
not here's the collaboration here's the common

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.360
ground here's what we have in common let's
build on it right.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:46.680
Now I've been in real-world situations where
I mean 98% of the potential support you can

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.720
get and the crucial collaborations you need
are of course with meat eaters and quite possibly

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.960
with people who are hunters.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.960
Whether it's here in Yunnan or in Cambodia
or Laos or Canada I mean most of the crucial

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.990
people you need partnerships with our government
officials our guard and bureaucrats would

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.990
have you.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.390
There's a beautiful, beautiful species of
monkey here in yunnan right on the border

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:15.080
between you nan and Myanmar and it's down
to its last couple of trees of habitat that's

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.990
not an exaggeration I saw a documentary where
the you know the camera panned over the last

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.861
little tiny piece of habitat where they're
existing in the wild but other than that they

00:11:23.861 --> 00:11:25.640
exist in zoos.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:31.030
I would love to be part of a foundation you
know ultimately funded by donations by people

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:36.870
like you, were you work to try to bring back
this species of monkey from the the brink

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.950
of extinction and it is as it happens a very
cute a very endearing very harmless looking

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.580
species of a monkey it's really especially
heart-rending to see them in zoos or to see

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.490
the film of them.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.890
[Music]

00:11:51.890 --> 00:12:03.870
“There are very few left…”

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:21.640
“I know
“They’re in the forest, in [Chinese]

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:45.720
“…they will catch them and kill them,
sell them”

00:12:45.720 --> 00:13:09.800
“[Also in] Nu jiang
“[There is a] monkey market”

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:16.100
So you know in some ways, I say you could
do the fundraising, we all know it's easier

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.330
to do fundraising for cute animals than for
ugly animals, it's easier to do fundraising

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.590
for cute little monkeys that hold their babies
the same way humans do, that breastfeed their

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:28.190
babies you can look at the cute babies and
the struggle of this family of monkeys to

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.630
survive in the trees.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.090
That's very moving, that's very evocative,
it's easier to do fundraising for that then

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:39.830
save the Sharks, right sharks not so photogenic
not so cute, but nevertheless with a project

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:46.940
like that, if your conception of purity is
we only work with other vegans, how can you

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.420
possibly make progress.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.031
Here in China the main people you need to
sit down and have lunch with and hammer out

00:13:53.031 --> 00:13:57.150
agreements with and cooperate with are government
officials, are current members of the Communist

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.060
Party, current members of the are busy current
members the government though that's absolutely

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.670
crucially the cooperation you need to have
and then beyond that any other ecological

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.860
groups any other groups interested in biodiversity
species conservation habitat conservation

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.750
etc of course they're gonna be non-vegan and
quite likely they're gonna be involved in

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:18.440
either hunting or forms of ecotourism that
you find morally objectionable.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:23.870
Now you know the counterpoint to this is this
is easy for you guys to imagine in a place

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:28.610
like the United States or Canada if I do have
cooperation with a group that engages in hunting

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:36.590
it may be impossible for us to get past something
as simple as a fundraising event at which

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:41.090
they want to have a barbecue at which they
want to sell barbecued pork right let's look

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:46.310
guys I'm sorry either we can't cooperate or
we can't do this joint fundraiser you guys

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:50.080
have to have a separate fundraiser and we
have to openly say we're against it you know

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:56.000
can we can we move past this but something
as simple as a barbecue pork fundraiser which

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.790
is very very common in the United States.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.560
I don't know why Americans love like even
the Cancer Foundation to see the counselor

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:07.190
of Cancer Foundation's in the states doing
barbecues to raise money for cancer research

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.000
great idea guys you're selling hotdogs to
try to cure answer it's ridiculous.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.500
Those are so as I say in principle I'm open
to that kind of cooperation but in practice

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:23.480
I recognize those insuperable barriers as
simple as they may be that may make cooperation

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:29.730
with non-vegans impossible so this runs totally
counter to the purity mentality because the

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:35.360
purity based mentality is about me being the
best vegan I can be which is understandable

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:42.980
that part is sympathetic but that's in the
pursuit of a personal identity a personal

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:48.060
status personal professional personal purity
as a vegan and my view of veganism is about

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.720
reaching out beyond myself reaching out to
other people reaching out to other groups

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:59.420
reaching out to get politically organized
to have the maximum impact on real world outcomes

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:04.000
and those real-world outcomes may be preserving
a particular forest it may be getting a particular

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.450
petition to Parliament it may be passing a
new law you know it may be a lawsuit against

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:14.560
a particular meat producing company you know
a lawsuit that's gonna draw attention to these

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:19.570
ethical issues or health issues or ecological
issues we hail look if we get our money together

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:24.110
we do scientific testing on this river we
can prove that this slaughterhouse is poisoning

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:28.540
the river then we can take that information
take it to court take it to the press we can

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.220
make a showcase where we say hey look we want
to talk about the ecological responsibility

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:37.089
and ethics of this slaughterhouse and more
broadly the meat industry great that's what

00:16:37.089 --> 00:16:44.570
I want I want maximum outcomes maximum impact
maximum social change to ultimately make the

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.630
world a better place or make my little piece
of society a better place.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:52.140
Maybe it is just to help one species of monkey
maybe it is just help one species of dolphin

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:59.850
maybe it is just to help one little piece
of land and maybe doing that involves a lot

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:05.290
of really uncomfortable uncomfortable compromises
that run counter to my own moral code my own

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:10.079
sense of personal purity but I want to get
my hands dirty I want to roll up my sleeves

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:16.020
I don't want this quest for personal purity
or personal perfection to impede my ability

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:21.949
to pursue those real-world outcomes that are
far beyond me and do not just involve my ever

00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:26.790
the circle of consumer choices that have negative
impacts in the world whether that be almonds

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.480
blueberries or what have you.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.450
Now sorry I could speak longer on the almond
issue and the indirect honey depression issue

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.190
but then I think this video would be much
too long if you guys want to hear about that

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.660
send me a message on patreon and I'll make
a separate video talk about that because during

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.850
the two-hour conversation with ModVegan and
we actually did talk about that at some length

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.590
and I got into some of the details.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:52.920
So you know I guess you could say the contrast
here is between the purity mentality and the

00:17:52.920 --> 00:18:00.000
policy change mentality, I am NOT vegan in
the pursuit of personal purity I'm vegan in

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.800
the pursuit of real-world policy changes.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.050
a bas le ciel.
