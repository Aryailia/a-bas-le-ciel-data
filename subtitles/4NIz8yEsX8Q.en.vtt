I'm<00:03:07.740><c> giving</c><00:03:07.980><c> you</c><00:03:08.070><c> this</c><00:03:08.220><c> precise</c><00:03:08.730><c> number</c><00:03:09.209><c> of</c>

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 align:start position:0%
I'm giving you this precise number of

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
exactly how many apples are in the truck
 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.350 align:start position:0%
exactly how many apples are in the truck
so<00:03:12.750><c> is</c><00:03:12.870><c> that</c><00:03:13.080><c> a</c><00:03:13.140><c> real</c><00:03:13.560><c> number</c><00:03:13.920><c> okay</c><00:03:14.850><c> all</c>

so is that a real number okay all
 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
