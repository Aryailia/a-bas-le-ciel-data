00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:05.130
I think, I mean you could state it as a question
you know, do you become vegan and then break

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.580
with the cultural norm because of veganism
or is it that you're someone who's already

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.870
broken with the cultural norm and then finds
it easy to engage with veganism.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.600
. . . I see that, you know, sincerely as
a really interesting piece of the puzzle and

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.600
maybe that's also why it's so difficult to
organize vegans, right?

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.529
Because you got a bunch of different people
and each one is kind of fragmented away from

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.820
their own home culture or rebelling against
it or acting out against it in different ways,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.040
but we're as different, we’re severally,
as different as I am from Fully Raw Kristina,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.149
we're as different as I am from Charles Marlow,
even we’re as different as I am from Gary

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.149
Francione.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.649
. . . I mean you know I’ve got to say it's
the burden that I've lived with all my life,

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.650
I really do feel that way, but veganism gave
me a coherent framework and a lens to understand

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.199
it and express it much better than before.

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.879
. . . In precisely the strictest sense of
the word perspective, it put all the other

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.809
problems in perspective, you could see what
was big and what was in fact small but close

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:09.470
to you, you know in contrast to things that
really were huge but perhaps you know more

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.290
remote.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:22.460
à-bas-le-ciel “The most value you’ve
brought to the vegan movement…” he says

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.310
I’m quoting him; “The most value you’ve
brought to the vegan movement has been critique

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.390
so far, but I think that will change as the
different approaches become crystallised for

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.909
people and you find your collaborators.”

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.680
. . . “You’ve had a big impact on clarifying
ideas for me, and I hope you will find your

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.910
activist group and for me more/better vegan
ones, and we can all inspire each other with

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.880
real world progress.”

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.540
. . . So he says here, he: “[agrees] with
another youtuber called theFlemface about

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.790
how it's easier to find veganism when you’re
already breaking with [your own] culture.”

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.490
Okay this is doubtless true and I think that's
also true about my engagement with Buddhism

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.780
and a lot of other things.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.040
I think Melissa has been reflecting on that
in some ways because you've just been we've

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.049
just gone back to visit your family and seen
a lot of things in your basement, see what

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.950
you grew up with, but I mean fundamentally
I was never comfortable in Canadian culture,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.950
period.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.720
Melissa: Yeah I was never comfortable in the
culture that I grew up with either.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.569
Right, right, so it's interesting.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.950
Melissa: I always felt distance from it.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.830
I think, I mean you could state it as a question
you know, do you become vegan and then break

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.280
with the cultural norm because of veganism
or is it that you're someone who's already

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.020
broken with the cultural norm and then finds
it easy to engage with veganism, and for some

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.290
people it’s gonna be both, there's not you
know what I mean like it doesn't have to be

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.090
all one of the other.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.780
But no I mean, I was really disgusted with
my own culture, I could go over some of the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.290
things, and of course it relates to particular
political events prior to 2001, relates to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.580
all these things, but sure you know I don't
know what it would be like for someone who

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.390
loves you know being an American who loves
living in Texas and his protest… and you

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.190
know who loves and is totally comfortable
with that culture and you know watches football

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.129
games and everything else and yet they're
vegan.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.700
We see that with the health based vegans and
so on often enough, but in terms of ethical

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.290
veganism I mean you know once you're an ethical
vegan, once you see the world in those terms,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.230
even just from the ecological perspective,
how you know how do you still watch football

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.680
the way you did before, you know I mean that
sincerely, I don't mean that as a taunt or

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.049
an insult to someone like what is the meaning
of your life now watching football and you

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.950
know doing those other things he used to do.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.600
Because from my perspective, you know ethical
veganism even if you just think of at the

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.959
ecological aspect, you think about the millions
of animals dying in cages all around the world

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.540
and now here you are at this football game,
even though you personally aren't eating ribs

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.590
at the football game and everyone else is,
it must suddenly make the other things in

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.439
your life seem you know meaningless and not
even not just meaningless but you know pernicious

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.280
as part of the destruction of the world, as
opposed to saving the world, as part of a

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.230
meaningless self-indulgent and destructive
life as opposed to a meaningful and helpful

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.230
one.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.970
So, again and like I'm not even saying this
to insult her, nor the flatter her, but you

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.580
can compare that to someone in Texas like
Fully Raw Kristina, Fully Raw Kristina obviously

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.440
could never fit into Texas in a million different
ways and you know she is Texan and she lives

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.380
in Texas, but it's not surprising she ended
up where she's at I guess with that perspective.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.820
So no, I see that you know sincerely isn't
a really interesting piece of the puzzle and

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.820
maybe that's also why it's so difficult to
organize vegans, right?

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.750
Because you got a bunch of different people
and each one is kind of fragmented away from

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.040
their own home culture or rebelling against
it or acting out against it in different ways,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.260
but we're as different, we’re severally,
as different as I am from Fully Raw Kristina,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.370
we're as different as I am from Charles Marlow,
even we’re as different as I am from Gary

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.370
Francione.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.790
I mean think about, think about that guy,
I mean Gary Francione is obviously incredibly

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.350
uncomfortable with the culture he's a part
of, Gary Francione, you get that rage and

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:09.910
that Sorrow in everything he does, you know,
just dissatisfaction too, just ranker, but

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.380
he's a salaried professor, I don’t know
if he's retired now you know, in many ways

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.840
he's a member of the establishments and so
on and yeah getting any two or three of those

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.441
people to cooperate seems to be impossible
even though I have so much in common with

00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:29.570
someone like Gary Francione, we can't even
agree on how to pronounce his name.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.590
. . . I mean I guess I can get into this in
a separate video, but for all of us I mean

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.110
that's ultimately what it comes down to, is
the number of hours in a day and how you can

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.450
make any of these aspirations you know to
save the world compatible with the challenge

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.410
of keeping a roof over your head, or providing
a decent standard of living to your own kids

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.160
if you have kids or any of these other things.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.870
I remember, there’s is saying in Buddhism
this is in Mahayana Buddhism but they say,

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.150
it is in some moderately ancient text, but
not the most ancient texts of Buddhism, it

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.870
says you know “practice the Dharma as if
your hat is on a fire,” you know if you're

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.819
wearing a hat that's on fire and you know
a lot of religions have that spirit of like

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:14.990
the world is gonna end so work really hard
and devote yourself to this whatever I mean

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.400
veganism it's weird I don't feel that the
world is gonna end I feel that the world is

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.940
bad and is getting worse, but I mean it's
a horrible, I mean it's an absolutely horrible

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:36.850
cosmology we live with as vegans, ethically
and ecologically and um you know I do still

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.420
ask myself that question every day you know
how would you live your life if you were trying

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:47.060
to save the world I have a daughter my daughter's
four years old I do prioritize spending down

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:53.190
with my daughter I do burn the jet fuel to
fly from Canada to France and spend my 15

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.480
days of my daughter you know and all these
things but sure when we're looking at these

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.229
options.

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:05.070
So he's talking about getting a university
degree and being a tree surgeon doing something

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:10.039
linked to ecology I you know I went to babe,
back when I was a political science major

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.400
I went to and I took classes in the Department
of Ecology at another university, not worth

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.660
throwing the whole story, but it was a ton
of work it was taking the subway for so many

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.849
hours across town and then he'd get out and
take a bus to go from one universe to the

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:25.520
other, just to be in this Department of Ecology,
I was trying to talk to people there because

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.190
I really thought at that time I should maybe
switch my major from Political Science to

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.830
Ecology or something like Political Ecology.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.760
I was wanting to make a difference and of
course when I got there, departments a joke,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.789
the courses are a waste of your time, you
know how it is, you know how universities

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:44.660
are, we've done a million videos talking about
that, But my problem is I have no delusion,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.330
it would be a wonderful delusion if I thought
that getting a PhD in Ecology could make any

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:54.821
difference in the world, even on this YouTube
channel, I don't think if I got a PhD in Ecology

00:07:54.821 --> 00:07:59.330
would even help this YouTube channel in any
way, I don't think it would help the vegan

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.330
world.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:07.470
If I got a PhD in Ecology I don't think there's
anything I could do that Gary Francione hasn't

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:13.979
already done or even the Gary Yourovsky hasn't
already done, without having a PhD in ecology,

00:08:13.979 --> 00:08:18.430
you know and I don't think they’d teach
me anything I couldn't learn you know, okay

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.240
I don't mean that, they would teach me a lot
of things, but they wouldn't teach me what

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.990
I need to know to move beyond what people
like Gary Franconine and Gary Yourofsky have

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.990
already done.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.390
So both of us are people now we're looking
at more higher education we were looking at

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.070
we had a video on it recently looking at whether
or not we should become lawyers go to law

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:42.860
school but then you look at that and you contrast
it to you know going to get a degree in culinary

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.980
arts getting a degree in bacon getting a degree
in pastries working in a kitchen rolling out

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.890
bread and ask yourself what can really be
a platform for making that difference in the

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:57.570
world anyway it's heavy, so we were laughing
and joking around a lot before we came on

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.570
camera.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.550
But I mean that really is the burden, I mean
you know I’ve got to say it's the burden

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:08.610
that I've lived with all my life, I really
do feel that way, but veganism gave me a coherent

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.250
framework and a lens to understand it and
express it much better than before.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:18.690
Melissa was exactly like me in this, before
I was vegan I cared way more about never owning

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.740
a car and by the way I still never have owned
the car right, still never have driven a car

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:28.060
alright and then after I was vegan you see
that kind of thing in this much more meaningful

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:33.160
quantitative framework, you know and I remember
like some of my ex-girlfriends when I first

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:39.410
got with them they were really hyper about
never using a plastic bag and I said to them

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.890
do you want me to show you the stats, do you
want me to show you what percentage of the

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:49.220
human waste stream, that's what people call
it, the human waste stream is reusable plastic

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.370
bags, do you want me to show that, and the
difference between using a reusable and disposable,

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.370
you want me to show that?

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.660
I can get you that now.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.160
And in some studies you know the reusable
plastic bags cause more pollution as well,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.630
it's a really near thing, it's like okay now
do you want to look at the difference between

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.440
you know meat versus tofu, this kind of thing.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:14.480
I'm not saying veganism is the only you know
ecological or ethical cause, but veganism

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.850
was both the ineluctably conclusion of those
questions and those misgivings, and it was

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.930
also something where once I switched into
veganism, all those other questions you know

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.130
made more sense.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:31.079
In precisely the strictest sense of the word
perspective, it put all the other problems

00:10:31.079 --> 00:10:39.440
in perspective, you could see what was big
and what was in fact small but close to you,

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:46.740
you know in contrast to things that really
were huge but perhaps you know more remote.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.630
à-bas-le-ciel
