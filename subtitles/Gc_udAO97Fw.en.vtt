makes<00:20:20.290><c> sense</c><00:20:20.560><c> that</c><00:20:21.010><c> he'd</c><00:20:21.190><c> take</c><00:20:21.640><c> steroids</c><00:20:21.940><c> to</c>

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:22.390 align:start position:0%

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.020 align:start position:0%
makes sense that he'd take steroids to
come<00:20:22.570><c> and</c><00:20:22.780><c> say</c><00:20:22.900><c> for</c><00:20:23.200><c> that</c><00:20:23.230><c> had</c><00:20:23.410><c> to</c><00:20:23.560><c> feel</c><00:20:23.740><c> better</c>

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:24.030 align:start position:0%

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.530 align:start position:0%
but uh yeah it's doing something to him
I<00:20:27.070><c> think</c><00:20:27.310><c> it's</c><00:20:27.520><c> a</c><00:20:27.640><c> combination</c><00:20:27.910><c> of</c><00:20:28.180><c> his</c><00:20:28.300><c> diet</c>

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:28.540 align:start position:0%
I think it's a combination of his diet
 

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.850 align:start position:0%
I think it's a combination of his diet
and<00:20:28.780><c> maybe</c><00:20:28.900><c> some</c><00:20:29.140><c> of</c><00:20:29.200><c> the</c><00:20:29.260><c> steroids</c><00:20:29.740><c> he's</c>

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:29.860 align:start position:0%
and maybe some of the steroids he's
 

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.890 align:start position:0%
and maybe some of the steroids he's
