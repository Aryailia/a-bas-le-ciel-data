00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.140
First, I am not vegan because I am vegan, or to be part of a community ...

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.430
 In just 5 seconds, "Unnatural Vegan" mentions the other topic for which I can be considered.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.590
 infamous, for treating it very bluntly [laugh] and realistically: community.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.989
 In the past, I have made several videos talking about what it means to say that vegans

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:26.989
 they are a community.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:33.850
 Have we been a community? Will it be that at some point we put the batteries as a community?

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.540
 Unnatural Vegan brings an interesting point she is not in it for the community.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.170
 It is not your goal.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.820
 It is not your concern.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.940
 Well, I differ from her and this is not a criticism of her, it is a personal difference that I think

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.800
 it is worth reflecting; I am more ambitious.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.430
 I am more voracious than that.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.699
 Yes, I want a real community.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.149
 Look at "Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD)" they have an office in every state

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.149
 from USA

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.149
 There are 50 states in the United States.

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.030
 They have over 50 offices with dedicated staff, open all the time, we don't.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.960
 Tell me, in 2016 what message is most important? Mothers Against Drivers

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.920
 Drunk or veganism? It is veganism.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.890
 Even though in the past, in the '80s maybe there was an argument.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.810
 MADD was an important council, today, veganism is a message that you definitely need

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.090
 50 offices in the United States.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.060
 I lived during a period in which homosexual groups went from being marginal, to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.060
 be very influential.When I lived in Toronto, there were a lot of gay offices,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.729
 offices that dealt with the rights of this community, including a single one dedicated to lesbianism.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.950
 multiple offices and multiple perspectives If controversy arose, the newspapers

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.260
 they could go and interview these organizations.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.369
 They were non-profit organizations, political organizations, whatever ...

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.770
 If the police commissioner made a homophobic comment, the newspapers would go and interview.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.650
 "Well, let's go to this foundation and this group that defends homosexual rights and get

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.799
 your opinion about it. "Something like that, that's a real community.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:11.890
 That is a face, a reflection that there was in Toronto, at that time a gay community

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.740
 real, they had a neighborhood, buildings and offices.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.670
 They had lawyers, nightclubs, festivals, I'm talking about the gay community in Toronto, it's not

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.920
 thus in all cities there were several, very well organized and vocal communities

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.920
 gay and newspapers could go where they.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.410
 It would be different if we were at the MADD level, it would be different if we were

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.010
 at the level of Jews in British Columbia Jews are a minority in this part

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.760
 Canada have institutions, they have real organizations, they have college scholarships and all

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.340
 types of benefits for people starting with the cradle to the grave, and lately you

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.819
 you can go there and attend a picnic and chat with other human beings face to face of collecting

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.870
 funds to things that can make a big impact.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.470
 I want it all, I want a real community.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.920
 I do not see why to pretend that I do not want that, that I do not value it I do not see why to pretend that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.040
 veganism is completely satisfactory for me as just a diet or something I do

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.580
 only it will never have political ramifications.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.330
 By blood, I am Jewish, by belief I am a nihilistic atheist, yet for my life

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.239
 and that of my family, it would benefit me more to pretend to be a religious Jew, to participate in the

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.650
 temple, because Judaism in Canada can offer me a real community of picnics

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.940
 to retirement homes.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.129
 From picnics to private schools to retirement homes.

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.040
 From the cradle to the grave.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.890
 Life cycle benefits are offered by Judaism, Mormonism and other ideologies

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:46.120
 crazy where do you believe in a god that does not exist or that you pray to someone who will never

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.120
 hear.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:04:01.730
 Unless you say your prayers on YouTube where your followers hear you.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.629
 I look at groups like Mormons and say: I want it all.

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:14.880
 I want everything you have For Mormons, it is nothing to organize a picnic where 200

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.920
 people are coming, okay? For me, not even that is enough.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.540
 It is nothing to Mormons to organize a fundraiser to help orphans

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.930
 or start a charity to change the world.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.020
 I want vegans to have that.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.890
 I am concerned about the life cycle from cradle to grave.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:49.040
 I have a 3-year-old daughter, I don't see her very often, she lives in Europe and I'm living in

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.560
 the China.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:05:09.170
 However, where is my daughter going to go to school? Where will my daughter go to

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:20.950
 the nursery? Where am I going to retire or where are my grandparents going to retire? From

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.020
 the cradle to the grave.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.760
 The problems of the gay community changed over time.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.370
 Recently, the gay community fought strong struggles, now the gay community can celebrate

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.410
 that many of those battles have been won in Canada.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.660
 In Saudi Arabia and other countries, the fight for gay rights is another story.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.380
 in his childhood But Canada was one of the first countries to legalize marriage

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.590
 between gays and I fight for equal rights Those battles have been won.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.030
 The battles of veganism are just beginning.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.130
 Where is that office? Where is that neighborhood, that nightclub? Where

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:15.610
 is that retirement home and nursery? I want everything.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.250
 I am fundamentally more ambitious than Unnatural Vegan.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:29.240
 I am not satisfied with what you call "community," I am not satisfied with a group of people

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.880
 self-indulgent middle-aged giving each other Facebook likes.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.860
 I'm not satisfied with a bunch of teenagers on Instagram photographing their buttocks in a

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.030
 bikini declaring that they are changing the world, none of that is enough for me.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.680
 OK? I want more.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.750
 Can I have it today? No.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.640
 Can I have it next year? No.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.780
 Am I going to see it before I die? Maybe.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.280
 MADD launched in no time.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.580
 What percentage of Americans support MADD? It's really a minority who support

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.180
 a foundation like that and they make it successful.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:16.950
 What percentage of people donate to Jewish temples in Canada? A very small minority.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.010
 I have spoken before about Sikhism in Canada, a small religious movement.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:33.430
 And again with gays, homosexuality is not a diet they have no need to

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:42.560
 separate restaurants but they have them! In Toronto, there is a gay district, there are restaurants

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:52.290
 gay even though there is no gay food! Vegans already have a reason to build buildings

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.210
 like restaurants.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:08:00.290
 Yes, I want it all, from cradle to grave, from physical temples to lawyers, from

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.440
 political organizations to foundations so respected that when there is a controversy

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:11.100
 in government, newspapers can call foundations where there is a voice advocating for

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.730
 veganism in Parliament, newspapers, on the street.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:20.960
 Yes, I love it, and I can admit that I do not have it, that is a true community

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.360
 and we are going to have to work very hard to get it.
