00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.889
When you're a child, presuming that your parents
beat you…

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.680
Not everyone is beaten by their parents but
millions of us are…

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.560
You know, as soon as the child figures out
the look in the parent's eye that means you

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.730
are going to be beaten, then the look in the
eye is more terrifying than the stick or the

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.510
fist, because you know what that look in their
eye means.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.940
First you learn to fear the stick, then you
learn to fear the fist, then you learn to

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.100
fear the look in a person's eye.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.649
But then, as childhood goes on and you develop
more of an awareness of yourself, of your

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.350
own strength, of your own tenacity, of your
own own obduracy, of your own will; then you

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.170
move on, and you learn to feel contempt for
the threat, the look in the eye, the fist,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.170
the stick.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.249
Then you learn to appreciate a sense of your
own strength, of your own ability to overcome

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:54.979
that challenge.

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:01.089
The awareness that you can be whipped and
you can be beaten, and you're stronger than

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.089
that.

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:09.439
I got a reasonably profound question the last
time I was live-streaming and I thought I'd

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.120
make an effort to give it a reasonably profound
answer.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.690
There was a question from the audience about
the meaning of happiness in my life and already

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.799
there's a sort of peculiar puzzle in the fact
that we're using the word happiness and not

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.880
the word satisfaction.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.869
I think with happiness we almost have a double
meaning.

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.340
Is happiness something fleeting; is happiness
something durable; is happiness something

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.520
shallow or is happiness something profound.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.600
And if we ask those same questions about satisfaction,
I think we'd actually come to very different

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.270
answers, even though happiness and satisfaction
are so closely linked in their meanings in

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.450
English language.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.420
And this question is really interesting to
answer at this particular time in my life.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.149
Right now I have custody of my daughter legally
for just 15 days.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.479
I've flown to the South of France with my
girlfriend whom I'm very much in love with.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.080
So I'm here with my girlfriend, under the
palm trees, on the beach, in an ostentatiously

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.210
beautiful part of the world, living a lifestyle
that many people might aspire to, or might

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.400
associate with the highest happiness possible.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.870
This is sort of the land where there are flowers
in bloom all around me, birds singing in the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.480
trees and we do indeed get to swim in the
azure ocean, these sorts of things.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.230
Although if it were not for my daughter, I
would be doing none of it, because these are

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.760
not my priorities in life, this is not what
motivates me.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.270
I would never go on vacation; that's why I
would never go on a beach vacation of any

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.400
kind.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.670
If it weren't for my daughter, and these these
strange circumstances.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.400
So the question of what is happiness and how
it shapes the behavior of other human beings

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.300
around me, and how it does and doesn't shape
my behavior, is something that's been on my

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:08.030
mind, along with the overweening questions
of duty, honor, and obligation, because obviously

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.870
my relationship with my daughter is very much
in my mind (day by day and in looking ahead

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.360
to the months and years in the future we're
trying to plan for, in trying to plan my education

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.820
and career for).

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.870
Many people watching this video will expect
me to answer (many people who are regular

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.591
viewers of mine, people who have known me
for a few years to whatever extent)… they're

00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:36.420
probably expecting an answer that either comes
out of Schopenhauer's school of thought Schopenhauer's

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.320
school of philosophy (which I do actually
have some videos on) or reflecting my background

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.290
in Buddhism and Buddhist philosophy.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.820
I was a scholar of Buddhism for many years
(I like to say 10 years for round numbers;

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.650
I want to think about how many years it was)…
especially Theravada Buddhism.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.870
I learned to read Pali.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.211
I did a lot of original scholarship and lived
in Buddhist countries and so on.

00:03:56.211 --> 00:04:00.840
And you can say, to make a long story short,
that both the philosopy of Arthur Schopenhauer

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.210
and the philosophy of Buddhism at its core
(Theravada Buddhism especially) really do

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.960
depict happiness as a false God, as something
you should not plan your life around, as something

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:21.830
you should not allow to distort your goals
(as an intellectual or simply as a man).

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.470
That's not really the main message or theme
I'd want to reflect on here, although I'll

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.180
come back to it, because there there's some
sense in which my involvement with Buddhism

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.760
and my involvement with the philosophy of
Schopenhauer reflects certain aspects of my

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.570
character.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.700
But you know, the people who are really close
to me, the people who know me in life and

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:46.530
not just on YouTube, they see me in circumstances
where other people would be struggling, where

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.870
other people would be suffering, where other
people were miserable, and I'm ebullient.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.560
Ebullient meaning really happy; happy and
smiling and laughing and even singing.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.340
My girlfriend and I went through a situation
in an airport recently, it was actually Bangkok

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.330
Airport; we flew via Bangkok Airport coming
here to France.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.850
And it was it was a disaster at the airport;
it wasted about three-and-a-half hours of

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.040
our lives; it was a horrible horrible situation
at the airport.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.880
And I never stopped smiling.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.880
I never stopped laughing.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.950
I was really kind of buoyed up by it and joyous
in dealing with it.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.440
And, again, that's a side of my character,
you'd really have to know me to see it, you

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.240
have to live with me or work with me to see
it.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.930
You'd never see it on YouTube or you'd never
get that sense from reading my essays, or

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.550
reading my written work, or even reading book-length
works from me.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:49.610
I respond to those kinds of challenges not
with phony optimism, not with a contrived

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.450
cheerfulness; I'm really, actually happy in
dealing with it.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.150
And I do have more extreme examples of that,
too.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.590
I can think of there's one situation where
somebody was threatening to kill me was really

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.750
a credible threat somebody, was threatening
to murder me.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.980
And I was smiling and laughing and happy and
so on.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.940
If anything I had to try to behave less happy
than I was in dealing with it.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.580
It wasn't contrived, I really felt that way.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.150
The only philosopher I know to talk about
this (this aspect of my life, and I think

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.240
it's an aspect of other people's lives in
general) is actually the philosopher Max Stirner,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.110
who also has a… there's a video on this
channel about his philosophy.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.650
Max Stirner is the only guy I can remember
who talks about the obduracy of children and

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:42.490
the sense of oneself that develops when you
face up to challenges when you defy things

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.650
that maybe at first as a child seemed impossible
to defy.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.990
Stirner talks about the fact that when you're
a child, presuming that your parents beat

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.990
you…

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.760
Not everyone is beaten by their parents but
millions of us are…

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.620
You know, as soon as the child figures out
the look in the parent's eye that means you

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.800
are going to be beaten, then the look in the
eye is more terrifying than the stick or the

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.590
fist, because you know what that look in their
eye means.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.010
First you learn to fear the stick, then you
learn to fear the fist, then you learn to

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.169
fear the look in a person's eye.

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:23.720
But then, as childhood goes on and you develop
more of an awareness of yourself, of your

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.430
own strength, of your own tenacity, of your
own own obduracy, of your own will; then you

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:36.150
move on, and you learn to feel contempt for
the threat, the look in the eye, the fist,

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.310
the stick.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.330
Then you learn to appreciate a sense of your
own strength, of your own ability to overcome

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.060
that challenge.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.730
The awareness that you can be whipped and
you can be beaten, and you're stronger than

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:50.730
that.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.740
And even if you weep that the tears are meaningless
and fleeting and so on.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.970
I remember Max Stirner talking about the psychology
of childhood; he had some reflections on a

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:06.160
very peculiar form of happiness that, you
know, you might call thriving on misery.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.810
But this sense of your own strength, this
sense of your own obduracy, this sense that

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.680
you can overcome this challenge that's in
front of you, and of being buoyed up by it,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.560
of being happy about it.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.750
That's an element of my character that certainly
came out during this strange situation at

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:27.170
the airport… three and a half hours of misery
at the airport, but I was not miserable.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.710
My girlfriend was really asking me, you know,
my girlfriend was asking me how should she

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.719
behave.

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:36.029
She said, look, do you want me to pretend
to be happy?

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:39.419
I said, no, don't pretend: I'm not pretending.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:48.480
I said, for me, I have a liberating feeling
of doing the best I can.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.290
And doing the best you can means different
things to different people.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:58.529
But as long as I am doing the best I can,
I know I can't do anything better than this,

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:00.209
so I don't suffer at all.

00:09:00.209 --> 00:09:04.170
I'm not standing there in the airport worried
like, "Oh, am I going to miss my flight?

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.829
It's going to be all my fault."

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:11.879
I'm doing everything I can,
and then beyond that, I have that peculiar

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:20.770
low-level joy described described by Max Stirner
of knowing that I don't fear the fist, and

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:26.619
I don't fear the rod, and I don't fear the
look in the other person's eye that brings

00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:30.660
those threats with them or what have you.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.300
I enjoy the feeling of my own capacity to
cope, if you like.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:43.050
And that is a durable form of happiness that
I have with me always and that I've experienced

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.740
in a lot of really extreme situations;
including, you know, threats of violence and

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.681
people threatening to kill me, or threats
that have to do with my livelihood or, you

00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:58.579
know, impacting my life in some really significant
way otherwise.

00:09:58.579 --> 00:10:02.389
And I guess for people who don't feel it,
it's difficult to describe.

00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:06.800
And I guess for people who don't understand
it, looking in from the outside, they might

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:12.560
perceive me as reckless, but actually what
I'm doing is not reckless at all, it's perfectly

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.689
self-controlled.

00:10:14.689 --> 00:10:19.269
And I would say further, I only feel that
way in situations where the nature of the

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:21.860
crisis is not my fault.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.499
So I don't feel guilty for anything that's
going wrong at the airport: none of it's my

00:10:26.499 --> 00:10:27.929
fault, and so on.

00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:31.179
It would be much much different, obviously,
if I were in a situation where I was taking

00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:35.800
care of my daughter, and there was a problem
that was my fault.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.920
Then you have feelings of guilt and responsibility,
and I'd be aware of my own daughter's inability

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:46.259
to cope, which is very different from that
sense of joy in my own ability to cope.

00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:52.379
So that is one sense, the ability to thrive
on misery, the ability to overcome obstacles

00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:59.309
and have a feeling of one's own obduracy,
and being aware of one's own fearlessness

00:10:59.309 --> 00:11:03.430
in dealing with problems that used to cause
fear (even if they were only things you would

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.569
have feared in childhood, or maybe things
you would have feared when you were younger

00:11:06.569 --> 00:11:10.429
and more inexperienced as a teenager, in your
early twenties, whatever the case may be).

00:11:10.429 --> 00:11:17.200
You can think of your own examples here.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.449
But there is still some sense in which I do
identify with the critique of happiness presented

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:26.670
by Arthur Schopenhauer, presented by Theravada
Buddhism.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:33.399
I find myself walking the streets here of
the Côte d'Azur, this beautiful part of France,

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:41.300
and yes, the idea that somebody would be captivated
by the sight of a yacht, of an expensive boat,

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.379
and think that they want that to be happy
[is absurd to me];

00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:49.309
we're passed on the street by very expensive
cars (Ferraris and Porsches and what have

00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:53.360
you), the idea that somebody would see that
and desire that and would take that on as

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:59.100
a goal; the idea that someone like myself
might come here and then go back to Canada

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.230
and feel motivated that they have to save
up money so that one day they can be the person

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.839
in the yacht or they can be the person in
the fancy car with an apartment here in the

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:14.459
South of France, on the beach, that is contemptible
to me in a sense that's shallow and profound

00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:17.179
at the same time.

00:12:17.179 --> 00:12:20.480
But I can't even say that is something I believe,
or something that I have chosen.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.139
I really think that's an aesthetic difference
between myself and other people more than

00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:29.170
it even as a moral difference or a choice.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.660
None of those things; I'm not drawn to any
of those things; I never have been and I think

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.540
I never could be.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:40.579
When I first enrolled in University (the University
of Toronto), my major was economics.

00:12:40.579 --> 00:12:46.629
When people asked me why, I answered, because
I wanted to study the philosophy of poverty.

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:48.129
I've always been drawn to poverty.

00:12:48.129 --> 00:12:52.889
I've always been drawn to the devastation
of war; the post-war struggle, the struggle

00:12:52.889 --> 00:12:56.120
to reconstruct a society after a disaster,
war or famine.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.890
I've always been concerned about genocide,
including the slow-motion genocide about against

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:06.170
Canada's own people, questions of endangered
languages enduring, and the injustice is of

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:11.589
the British Empire in creating Canada, the
country I was born into, and so on.

00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:16.380
But, we can talk about those things philosophically
we can talk about them politically, but I

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.860
can also just say there's a level on which
it's aesthetic.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.170
And the truth is my parents brought me to
France when I was a child, they brought me

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:30.589
to Italy and few other parts of Europe; I
saw all this splendor, and to me there was

00:13:30.589 --> 00:13:32.910
nothing splendid in it.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:40.449
And I was never interested in having a life
lived in pursuit of those creature comforts.

00:13:40.449 --> 00:13:46.319
I wanted a life that was full of suffering
and defined by suffering but where it was

00:13:46.319 --> 00:13:50.709
meaningful suffering.

00:13:50.709 --> 00:13:54.470
I wanted to live a meaningful life as I defined
it.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.649
And I did that.

00:13:55.649 --> 00:14:01.939
I can tell you honestly that if I die tomorrow
or if I died yesterday, I did live a meaningful

00:14:01.939 --> 00:14:04.679
life already, by my own definition.

00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:08.389
And now I'm moving on to a very new and different
chapter of my life.

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:12.660
I say this as the floor is covered with toys
for my daughter.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:18.420
We spent about eight hours today with my daughter,
going to the beach and sitting on this floor,

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.249
playing with these toys, and played some video
games, too, and so on.

00:14:22.249 --> 00:14:28.069
It's taken on a new dimension and a new direction.

00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:35.449
But no, my life has never been about happiness,
and that's both the short and the long answer

00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:37.879
to that question.
