00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
so as I always try to say at the
beginning of these types of videos where

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.410
I'm talking about you know people will
no longer being vegan you know I'm not

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.670
here to tell them to stop eating animal
products. I'm not here to tell them to

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.660
stop eating animal products. I'm not here
to tell them to stop eating animal products.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.020
[Music] Look, I know that veganism
can be really hard for a lot of people

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.359
the problem is not with them no longer
being vegan; the problem, the problem is

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.030
not with them no longer being vegan. We're
supplementing with some organ meats some

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.100
eggs some sardines… ghee…&nbsp;ghee, yeah…

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.530
I'm not here to tell them to stop eating
animal products

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.439
The idea that this can be ethical is
just wrong. No matter how well the

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.939
animals were treated while they were
alive. The problem is not with them no

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.549
longer being vegan. A lot of young women
that want to have a baby… yeah… vegan pregnancy

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.689
have a vegan family …works for everybody and it
doesn't… necessarily… it doesn't!

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.110
The second thing is that I was watching this
live video with him and his wife like a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.299
few years ago and someone in the chat
box said something about activism and

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:16.540
they both like looked at each other and
did this like cringy like inwards, like,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.209
smile or smirk. And they were, like, no,
we're not activists. And I was

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.260
thinking like wow like maybe you're not
an animal rights activist but is there

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.849
literally nothing, that you have no
message that you stand for enough in

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.590
life that you would call yourself an
activist?  This is a good example of I

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.130
guess over the last couple years why
I've become more in favor of the idea

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:51.280
that if you are going to be pregnant and
vegan if you are going to feed a child

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.430
and be vegan you need counseling. The
vast majority of us need to go see an

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.250
R.D. (medical doctor). We need help doing this
because so many of us do not know what we're doing

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.049
and when you are inflicting that on a
child you know it's one thing to do it

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.690
to yourself which is awful enough but to
do it to another person is just it's

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.349
just terrible. And you think I would have
I don't know softened my stance on that

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.099
since like having a kid and being
pregnant because I haven't had any

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.819
problems being vegan doing that but I
think part of just being an adult is

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.340
realizing that other people have
different lifestyles and different

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.919
knowledge than you have and obviously we
are not the normal way that we live even

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.930
in terms of just like you know my work
and everything right and the knowledge

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.040
that both of us have is very different
from the average person even from the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.759
average vegan I think would be really
dangerous for me to expect that every

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:54.220
parent is just fully capable of
feeding their child vegan. I'm not here

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.100
to tell them to stop eating animal
products. [Music]

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:07.080
Rather than telling you what I would say about Moon and Rock, I'll tell you what it is that I said to them.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.410
Dude,
you pay people to kill animals so that

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.850
you can eat the pieces of their
chopped up bodies. You buy milk-butter

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.160
(ghee) that's produced by cows living
their whole lives on a concrete floor

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.810
under a steel shed in constant misery
until the day they die. I used to be a

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:36.240
Buddhist and I was both a scholar and
a preacher. I know what it is to be "holy"

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.730
(quote/unquote "holy") and I know what it is to be perceived as holy in a religious

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:52.120
context. It's easy to be holy. It's also
easy to be wrong. Guys, you can probably

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.510
guess I would have become vegan earlier
in life if I hadn't been a member of a

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.820
mass, organized religion, that to some
extent did valorize drinking cow milk,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.190
that normalized it, that justified it,
that depicted the Buddha himself eating

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.220
cow-milk, curds and yogurt. Sure I know
that these people are trying in their

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:23.380
way to be religious leaders, or at least
religious followers, but it doesn't

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.380
really matter if you use religion as an
excuse for something. What you need to do

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:37.680
is examine why it is that you're making
excuses in the first place.
