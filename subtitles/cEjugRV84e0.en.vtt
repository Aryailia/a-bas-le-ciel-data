00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:06.580
Every stand-up comedian will tell you that
it's easier to get an audience to laugh when

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.610
it's someone else's religion that you're making
fun of,

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.770
and the hardest thing is to get people to
question and look at their own religion, their

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.770
own culture.
I don't know, maybe that just means that you're

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.770
not a very good stand-up comedian.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.789
Whenever we're talking about religion, I think it's important to ask, "Why are some subjects taboo?".

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.760
Why is it that they're not a laughing matter. Why is it that they're something we can't

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:12.700
talk about casually, critically, incisively?
Why is it that people sit up straight in their seats, or avoid the issue?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:25.100
Why is it that some issues get into the realm of hysteria, extreme opinions shutting down [any] discourse? And, uh, the whole question of the historical

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.100
Buddha... it's, it's in that area, where you
should ask, "Why is it that people fly off

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.549
the handle on this issue?"
Why is it that even respectable, academic

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.549
articles, will suddenly start shouting that,
y'know, somebody is an imperialist, somebody

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.060
is some kind of thought-criminal, for even
talking in terms of the historical Buddha?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.329
Why is that so loaded?
And, y'know, [if we] shift the frame of reference

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:05.329
to one of the most influential religions in
the history of the world that, today, nobody

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:12.329
believes in, [i.e.,] what about the cult of
Herakles? (A name you probably know as Hercules.)

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.930
You may have seen cartoons made out of the
guy. You may have seen a vase in a museum.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.930
You have thousands and thousands of artefacts
of Herakles, hundreds of stories, myths, legends,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.280
and if someone said to you, "You know, I think
you can look through the legends of Herakles

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.500
and pick out a few that represent the historical
reality of Herakles," nobody would get angry

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.730
[at this suggestion], nobody would get uncomfortable,
and nobody would accuse you of being an imperialist,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.980
or, ah, supporting some kind of terrible,
dangerous tendency.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.980
But, if you did that, all you would be doing,
is making a selection. You would be sitting

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.370
there, as a modern reader, looking at the
myths presented to you, looking at the archaeological

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.400
remains, and saying, "These are the ones that
appeal to me." These are my preference, these

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.060
are my choice.
So, you're not uncovering something new.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.520
If you compare a myth to a myth, the result
is a myth.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.980
You can engage in comparative mythology, but
all that you're discovering is your own preference,

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.560
your own selection. You're not producing new
evidence.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.560
With that being said, if you read ancient
sources, on Herakles, they were already interested

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.720
in this possibility. Already, in Herodotus,
your see Herodotus discussing that there's

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.150
a more theological Herakles, a figure of myth
and legend, but that there's also an historical

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.100
reality of a guy who was a king, a warrior,
and who was a real human being, and, you know,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.880
[there are] some questions as to how we can
separate the two, or what stories are theological

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.880
and what really reflect that reality (the
ultimate historical origins, of the myths

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.130
of Herakles).
Um, y'know, if you read Aristotle, there's

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.130
a moment where he discusses the fact that
in ancient Greece, the disease epilepsy was

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.150
named after Herakles. People would call it
"Herakles-disease", in the same way that today

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.750
we have diseases named after famous people,
famous people who happened to have the disease,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:43.750
like Lou Gehrig's Disease. And, y'know, for
sure, there's a feeling, that you're not treading

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.390
on the familiar ground of mythology any more.
There's a feeling that there's a human reality,

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.070
an historical reality, leaping off the page
at you there. And you realize that if there

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:01.070
was a big, strong guy named Herakles (probably
not super-human or supernatural), but if there

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.639
was a big, dangerous guy, and he had epilepsy,
then you imagine how memorable that would

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.600
be, and how terrifying that would have been,
for everyone who knew him, maybe for everyone

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.210
in his kingdom. Whenever he had a seizure,
whenever he had an epileptic fit, all the

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.830
people around him [would have] had to stand
back, or had to try to restrain him.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.830
So, it's natural for people to want to make
that selection, for people to look at mythology

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:38.670
and say, "Yeah, I choose this as historical
reality", but what you can't lose sight of

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.470
is that what you're doing is just an act of
selection. You're just revealing your own

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.400
bias, as a modern reader, as a modern interpreter.
And the ancient sources, like Herodotus, that

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.419
were looking back at even earlier sources,
they were engaged in the same thing. They

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:03.139
were saying, from their own perspective in
time, "Okay, this is what I feel is historically

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.830
real". This is what resonates with me, this
is what speaks to me.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:14.830
And, with the (sigh) idÃ©e fixe of the historical
Buddha, the real problem is we don't deal

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:23.430
with just one round of selection. Scholars
get into a cycle, and it's like the childrens'

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.240
game "broken telephone". First they select
some group of texts, some set of ideas, as

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.030
definitively historical, and then they get
into both manufacturing new evidence out of

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:46.000
it, and (even worse) suppressing other evidence.
[They] get into proposing, "Okay, let's pretend

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.260
this evidence doesn't exist, and (laughter)
let's pretend some other evidence does." That's

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.639
a little more complex, how scholars manage
to do that [i.e., misrepresenting evidence].

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:02.600
[With] the historical Buddha, once you've been through a few stages, a few cycles, in this game,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:14.070
you start to get an idea that while it was meant to select what's most meaningful, most interesting, most philosophical,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:21.070
maybe, out of the ancient texts, it instead
becomes a distorting, biased, myopic misrepresentation,

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:28.010
of what the texts do and don't say.
For me, one of the most common experiences

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.060
in my life has been (including when I speak
to people with PhDs in Buddhist Studies) that

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:40.060
when I just talk openly about hell being a
major part of Buddhism, there's... gasp! Suddenly

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.510
they draw in their breath. When I was giving
a lecture at S.O.A.S., the University of London,

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:51.580
during the question-and-answer period afterwards,
I said, "Yeah, of course, almost on every

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.479
page of the canon we're dealing with this
idea of hell and the afterlife," and... gasp!

00:07:54.479 --> 00:08:00.840
You could hear, people sat up in their seats,
people got uncomfortable. And that crowd,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.280
well, there were probably more Burmese people
in the crowd than any other ethnic group.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:12.280
We had white people, but also different Asian
scholars and students of Buddhism there.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:19.360
And, y'know, how can such a major idea become
taboo? Well, it's because people went through

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.020
a cycle of saying, "Oh, no, no, no, the real
Buddha, the original Buddha, the historical

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:32.380
Buddha, he didn't teach hell."
So, "therefore", ignore all of this evidence,

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.369
and direct your attention to only little bits
and pieces of evidence.

00:08:37.369 --> 00:08:44.369
Now, y'know, was there a real guy named Herakles?
Or that people called Herakles to flatter

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:52.829
him? [Was there this guy who] was big and
strong, and beat people to death with a club?

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:59.379
Or, was the club --as a symbol of Herakles--
something that only appears relatively late

00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:03.649
in the art-history, in the development of
iconography. Is that original or not? You

00:09:03.649 --> 00:09:10.399
can ask those questions, but the trick is
to never lose sight of your role as a modern

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:17.399
interpreter, asking those questions; and to
never, never let yourself, get into a frame

00:09:18.699 --> 00:09:25.699
of mind of denying what's on the piece of
paper in front of you; to never be the person

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:34.160
who takes on the role of imposing modern values
and modern expectations onto ancient texts.
