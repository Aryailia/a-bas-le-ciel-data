it--as the fact that she doesn't want to
 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
it--as the fact that she doesn't want to
have<00:06:15.810><c> children</c><00:06:15.889><c> like</c><00:06:16.889><c> you</c><00:06:17.039><c> know</c><00:06:17.099><c> I</c><00:06:17.130><c> mean</c><00:06:17.310><c> it</c>

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 align:start position:0%
have children like you know I mean it

have children like you know I mean it
would<00:06:17.460><c> just</c><00:06:17.490><c> be</c><00:06:17.669><c> a</c><00:06:17.699><c> human</c><00:06:17.940><c> thing</c><00:06:18.210><c> like</c><00:06:18.360><c> oh</c><00:06:18.509><c> okay</c>

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 align:start position:0%
would just be a human thing like oh okay
 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.029 align:start position:0%
would just be a human thing like oh okay
so<00:06:18.930><c> this</c><00:06:19.139><c> would</c><00:06:19.320><c> make</c><00:06:19.620><c> sense</c><00:06:19.770><c> because</c><00:06:19.830><c> she</c>
