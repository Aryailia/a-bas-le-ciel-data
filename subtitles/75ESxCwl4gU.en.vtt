that's<00:08:39.090><c> kind</c><00:08:39.390><c> of</c><00:08:39.420><c> the</c><00:08:39.510><c> background</c><00:08:39.690><c> I</c><00:08:39.960><c> think</c><00:08:40.950><c> I</c>

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the background I think I
 

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.250 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the background I think I
think<00:08:41.670><c> that</c><00:08:41.730><c> I</c><00:08:41.910><c> have</c><00:08:42.300><c> a</c><00:08:42.330><c> big</c><00:08:42.630><c> answer</c><00:08:42.930><c> to</c><00:08:43.170><c> that</c>

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
think that I have a big answer to that
so<00:08:43.560><c> I</c><00:08:43.770><c> think</c><00:08:44.370><c> that</c><00:08:44.820><c> the</c><00:08:45.000><c> people</c><00:08:45.360><c> who</c><00:08:45.570><c> are</c>

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.100 align:start position:0%
so I think that the people who are
