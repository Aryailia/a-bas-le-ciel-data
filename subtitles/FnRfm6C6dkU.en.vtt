00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.870
Do you think that rain makes you want to see the sky sometimes

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.030
 sometimes sometimes you want to see the sky sometimes you crawl up

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.689
 on the grass sometimes they stand at the top of a matt point that is afraid

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.660
 you want to see the sun, the moon and the clouds like we do

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.230
 I don't know do you think that the birds from above sometimes the world below

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.329
 want to see earth like earthworms do

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.769
 every day they see the same sky maybe sometimes they imagine

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.789
 there is another world under the earth where earthworms fly

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.239
 Sitting on the embankment and looking down imagine yourself like that

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.890
 Earthworms sit underground on their own little street lamps and

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.629
 look out to a world standing upside down when birds over a lake

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.799
 Would you like to fly?

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.350
 fish do imagine a second sun and

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.230
 a second and underwater in front of which only fish can see because they

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.430
 in the sky the sun see the moon and the clouds i think that they are

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.390
 can imagine how the fish underwater in their own world with their

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.080
 Live your own sun what do marine fish expect when they go to

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.140
 water surface come that an octopus and something about them

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.950
 hovers over him in another trampled ocean

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.549
 yes that's how it will be earthworms want to see the sky birds want to see

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.539
 See the earth and the fish were seeing the ocean high in the clouds

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.570
 and how about a and bold what do you mean

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.710
 I think cows want to see the sky too but they spend their time

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.260
 Whole life in it to produce milk, millions of cool people live in factories

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.210
 and never see the sky

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.720
 i think pigs want to see the sky too, but millions of their kind

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.650
 live their entire lives in factories just waiting to die

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.790
 if you look up you only see a metal roof

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.810
 and if you look down you only see a concrete floor

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.220
 imagine that the world outside only has a metal sky and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.069
 the forests and fields are made of cement and steel

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.810
 even earthworms want to see the sky
