00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.220
In the spring and summer there's a brand new
civil war in Asia!

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.840
It's in a place you've probably never heard
of before, and the eye-witness reports are

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.559
all in some language you probably can't understand.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.680
Some news reports say there are 30,000 refugees,
some say 60,000, but good luck finding even

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.600
a single western reporter on the ground, anywhere
near the conflict.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.900
Did you read about it in the newspaper?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.400
Not likely.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.760
Let's face it, the days when reporters would
walk through a minefield just to stand next

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.870
to a gunfight holding a notepad and a microphone
are long gone.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.510
The mainstream media maintains fewer and fewer
bureaus in major cities like Baghdad and Washington;

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.370
they don't have the budget to send reporters
to remote areas to cover unpopular wars.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.630
Instead, the only way you can get reliable
information about civil wars in poverty-stricken

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.080
countries is to donate money to strangers
on the internet --and, for some reason, the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.450
recipients tend to be the white, western and
university-educated (not the refugees themselves).

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.439
That's why we've formed the Foreign Observers
of Lesser Known Conflicts in Asia --or, F.O.L.K.C.A.--

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.009
to receive your donations.

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.049
What will we do with those donations?

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.219
We'll provide exactly the service that the
mainstream media have been failing to deliver

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:18.219
on.

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.600
Spending the vast majority of your money on
travel expenses, lobbying and "awareness raising"

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.600
activities.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.590
Reporting from the hotel room and pretending
we're on the front lines.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.539
Quoting government officials as if they were
refugees, soldiers or other eye-witness sources.

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.369
Interviewing English-speaking local in cafÃ©s,
and reporting rumors as facts.

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.040
Cynical posturing.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.359
Grandstanding.

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.189
Original research.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.749
You're probably wondering how this kind of
"citizen journalism" will make a positive

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:48.240
difference for the people actually suffering
on the ground.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.819
It's simple!

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.109
Step one: it all begins with donations from
viewers like you!

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:59.590
Step two: those donations get spent generating
hype in the media, and this leads to "public

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.509
awareness", but, more importantly, lobbying
politicians, with the politicians themselves

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.310
pandering to the same media hype.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.099
The final outcome is increasing C.I.A. and
military intervention from the United States

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.569
and its partners.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.060
If you don't believe that it works, just consider:
the hype surrounding the "Kony 2012" campaign

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.939
resulted in the U.S. increasing its military
budget from the tens of millions to the hundreds

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.459
of millions of dollars!

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.519
So, if you think the military-industrial complex
doesn't respond to public opinion, think again!

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.209
This civil war just started in February of
2015, so get in on the ground floor now, before

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.379
it's too lateâ€¦ to help someone.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.910
Your donations won't save lives, but they
will encourage military spending on a conflict

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.530
that Americans don't know about, don't care
about, and that the press probably won't even

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.530
be asking about a few years from now.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.210
Remember, you can't trust what you don't understand,
so when your donations pay for citizen journalism,

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.609
you're paying for someone slightly less ignorant
than yourself, to educate the public on your

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:14.989
behalf.
