00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.060
It's strange to see that so many centuries
after the persecution of Galileo the basic

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:15.910
concept of the heliocentric universe... sorry...
the heliocentric model of the solar system

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.040
is still controversial, and we have loud,
angry voices, on the internet, that are debating

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.820
whether the universe should be regarded as
geocentric or otherwise.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.170
What I find hilarious in this is that neither
the Christians nor the atheists are being

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.649
honest about what the matter is to be debated.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.350
Whether you regard it as being about religion,
or tradition, or history, or science, it is

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.420
not enough to only scrutinize skeptically
the positive scientific argument for how the

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.909
solar system works.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:00.489
It's a point that's actually of great historical
significance and even literary and symbolic

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.979
interest in understanding how the English
language evolved to look at what the Bible

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.280
does say, sincerely and with detachment, about
what the shape of the universe is.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.850
Why is it that we all grow up with these romantic
and poetic terms for the sky as "the heavens",

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.750
as being "the vault of the heavens", "the
heavenly firmament".

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.061
We've at least seen that in Shakespeare, even
if you had a totally secular upbringing, and

00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:32.659
if you had a religious upbringing you probably
read those words in the Bible without really

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.509
thinking about what they meant or why they
were used instead of clearer and more sensible

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.840
words, and possibly your family discouraged
you from asking hard questions.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.880
"Firm", why does the idea of "firmness" appear
within "firmament"?

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.819
I think, in general, as history went on, Bible
translators tried to be as poetic and vague

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:02.479
as possible in letting you know what the shape
of the world really was in most-ancient Judaism,

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.670
preserved in and re-articulated in Christian
tradition.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.709
Going back to the 14th century, the John Wycliffe
translation of the Bible, and his so-called

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.790
"first translation", [reads:] "the firmament
be made in the midst of the waters, and part

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.530
the waters from the waters".

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:34.519
The ancient Jewish view of the world (in first
temple Judaism) is that the ocean exists above

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.360
the sky, as well as below and surrounding
the ground that we're standing on, and that

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.750
when god created the world, he created the
vault of the heavens.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.209
The firmament [is supposed to be] a solid
material for the sky, so that the air we're

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.620
breathing is a bubble, with an ocean above
it, as well as an ocean below it.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.400
It's a view of the world that is totally surreal
and magical, from a modern perspective.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.080
It isn't a competitor with or an alternative
to the heliocentric view of the universe.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.000
It's not as if one is a model of an atom that
has the neutron in the middle, and the other

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.930
one has electrons in the middle, no, there's
absolutely no comparison.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.299
To use a totally modern, western translation,
the New International Version of the Bible

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:36.849
for the same passage says, "Let there be a
vault between the waters to separate water

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.750
from water".

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.280
Okay, the water above the "vault" of the heavens,
and the water below.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.690
That's how god supposedly created the universe.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.959
And in the later Wycliffe translation, going
back again to the 14th century, he was already

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.359
starting to become a little bit more poetic
in rephrasing this: "Be made a firmament in

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.680
the middle of waters, and divide it, waters
from waters".

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.680
Okay?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.329
If we're comparing the scientific model of
the solar system to the Biblical model of

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:20.580
the solar system we're comparing something
that makes sense to something that looks like

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:27.700
a Christmas snow-globe, except the water is
on the outside, the air is on the inside,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.230
and we have to imagine the sun and the moon
being much smaller than the earth, not larger,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.940
and as being nestled inside that bubble (that
god created for you to breathe in).

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.070
When you know that, all kinds of things make
sense, not just in reading the Bible, but

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.170
also reading Christian-influenced western
literature from Shakespeare's poetry on down.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.580
That's all I got for you, folks.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.320
If you want to be a skeptic, it doesn't just
mean "question the value of scientific claims",

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.200
it also means that you look skeptically at
the world's history, philosophy, language

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.060
and literature, with the same kind of detachment
that, uh, we supposedly or hopefully ascribe

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.670
to scientific process.
