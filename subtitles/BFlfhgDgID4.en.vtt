you see there's a leap between those two
 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.750 align:start position:0%
you see there's a leap between those two
ideas<00:04:09.549><c> those</c><00:04:10.549><c> are</c><00:04:10.730><c> two</c><00:04:10.940><c> very</c><00:04:11.560><c> philosophical</c>

when that belief gets refuted they think
 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.219 align:start position:0%
when that belief gets refuted they think
virtue<00:05:13.789><c> itself</c><00:05:14.150><c> becomes</c><00:05:14.660><c> meaningless</c><00:05:14.960><c> with</c><00:05:15.169><c> a</c>
