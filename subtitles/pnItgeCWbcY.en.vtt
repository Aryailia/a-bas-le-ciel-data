right<00:12:48.290><c> that</c><00:12:48.500><c> this</c><00:12:48.889><c> is</c><00:12:49.040><c> just</c><00:12:49.160><c> me</c><00:12:49.310><c> like</c>

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:49.550 align:start position:0%
right that this is just me like
 

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:53.230 align:start position:0%
right that this is just me like
rationalizing<00:12:50.360><c> no</c><00:12:51.199><c> it's</c><00:12:51.350><c> my</c><00:12:51.560><c> behavior</c>

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
rationalizing no it's my behavior
 

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.819 align:start position:0%
rationalizing no it's my behavior
no<00:12:53.389><c> which</c><00:12:53.540><c> doesn't</c><00:12:53.870><c> mean</c><00:12:53.930><c> it's</c><00:12:54.079><c> false</c><00:12:54.319><c> I</c><00:12:54.620><c> mean</c>

00:12:54.819 --> 00:12:54.829 align:start position:0%
no which doesn't mean it's false I mean
 

00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:55.900 align:start position:0%
no which doesn't mean it's false I mean
I'm<00:12:55.160><c> just</c><00:12:55.189><c> saying</c><00:12:55.490><c> I</c><00:12:55.519><c> think</c><00:12:55.699><c> that's</c><00:12:55.819><c> a</c>

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:55.910 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying I think that's a
 

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying I think that's a
rational<00:12:56.209><c> account</c><00:12:56.899><c> of</c><00:12:57.079><c> something</c><00:12:57.500><c> but</c><00:12:58.310><c> that</c>

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:58.370 align:start position:0%
rational account of something but that
 

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.939 align:start position:0%
rational account of something but that
that<00:12:58.819><c> but</c><00:12:59.060><c> that</c><00:12:59.240><c> is</c><00:12:59.509><c> you</c><00:13:00.350><c> know</c><00:13:00.500><c> like</c><00:13:00.769><c> in</c>

00:13:00.939 --> 00:13:00.949 align:start position:0%
that but that is you know like in
 

00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:03.939 align:start position:0%
that but that is you know like in
principle<00:13:01.550><c> yeah</c>
