00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.819
I was just thinking about this on my way home.

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.120
I don't know why I was thinking about it.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:15.640
But, um, y'know... the most brutally honest
stories you tend to get about corruption in

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.450
Buddhism tend to be from ex-monks, guys who've
been in the game for a few years and then

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.050
retired out of it, or whatever their particular
story might be.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.660
I guess I was kind of prepared for that right
off the bat; one of my professors in university

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.050
was himself a former Buddhist monk and he
was brutally honest about corruption in the

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.481
context he came from in Japan.

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:50.730
By his own account, y'know, his zen master
was sort of the most respected patriarch at

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.579
that time, or the most respected patriarch
who was open to the possibility of having

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.149
foreigners study with him.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.730
However, he was only taking on foreigners
who spoke Japanese fluently, and that was

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.360
something that my professor already did.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:14.619
Uh... anyway, so I was still an undergraduate
student myself hearing this story, but, ah...

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:24.299
my professor told me how the minute the zen
master fell asleep at this august and revered

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.920
temple, the minute he fell asleep (and he
went to sleep like clockwork at the same time

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:37.259
every night), all of the students (wearing
their full robes) would get up and climb over

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:47.060
the wall (the wall marking the boundary of
the temple) and would go to the nearest whorehouse.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.159
Not a nightclub, not a bar, a brothel.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:59.409
And, uh, he also specified that only a minority
of the monks would ever have sex when they

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.980
were out at the brothel.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.829
I don't know if that was due to piety or,
ah, due to poverty, or what the factors were,

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:16.310
but, um, he said just about all of them would
get drunk and smoke marijuana, and quite a

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.200
few of them used other drugs besides.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.969
Uh... his account had a lot of human details
added on to that (that I'm leaving out), but

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:32.189
I remember my questions at the time were just,
uh, "What was the attitude of the monk in

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.189
charge?

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.859
Didn't he mind, didn't he object, didn't he
try to discipline them?"

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.659
And, y'know, my professor, he was really trying
to teach me something.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:47.700
He said, no, as long as the monks could show
up the next day and perform the rituals with

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.879
the correct posture and attitude, as long
as they could sit in the correct position

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:01.041
during the meditation sessions, then the guy
in charge never had any complaints, uh, he

00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:03.109
allowed it to continue.

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:10.660
And my prof said, y'know, he would look around
the meditation hall, and he'd be able to see

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.761
which guys were struggling with a hangover
(who was more hung-over than the rest) and

00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:22.439
every so often some of the guys would have
been staying up so late, partying so hard,

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:27.959
they, uh... that during the long sessions
of sitting zen (where, y'know they sit in

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.010
a particular posture, with their knees together,
different from the Theravada posture), every

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.420
so often one of them would simply pass out,
sitting upright, and fall forward with a klonk,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:48.319
their head hitting the ground, passing out
from exhaustion.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:55.359
Y'know I appreciate the honesty that both
former monks and current monks expressed to

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.359
me.

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:03.532
Um, y'know, I think a lot of them could appreciate
the honesty with which I was engaged in what

00:04:03.532 --> 00:04:08.870
I was doing, what I was trying to do... and,
um...

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.659
I dunno, I certainly appreciated anything
real I was able to make contact with on the

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:21.769
other side, whether that was in monastic institutions
or academic ones or what-have-you.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:29.750
On the more poverty-stricken side of the game,
I knew a former monk in Laos, and when I knew

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.729
him he had become a, uh, communist bureaucrat
of a very low rank, but, obviously, in a communist

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.650
country a large percentage of people are employed
by the government as bureaucrats of one kind

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.650
or another.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:50.069
Bureaucracy gobbles up more and more of society
the further left you go on the political spectrum.

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:55.050
And, um... he told me that when he was quite
a young man (I don't know if he was a teenager

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:02.220
or in his 20s), he received a scholarship
to go from Laos to Thailand, and to study

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.979
in the number one temple in Chiang Mai.

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.900
So this is, y'know, on the kind of official
government-ranked list (which does exist in

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.580
a country like Thailand, the government and
the monarchy are quite involved in how religion

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:23.419
is organized there)... uh, this was the number
one, official "greatest temple" for Northern

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.330
Thailand, that of course doubled as a sort
of monastic university.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.849
So this guy received a scholarship, and this
would have been back in the more high, Soviet

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.830
period of Communism, when the relations between
the two countries were closer to war at any

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.930
given moment, so [this was] politically significant
as well as religiously significant.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.629
And when he got there, this earnest, communist
monk from Laos, when he got there expecting

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:55.970
to get an education in Buddhism, of course
what he got was an education in just how corrupt

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.080
Buddhism in Thailand really is.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.240
And, uh, the first time a big festival day
came up (I think it was Thai New Year, it

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.409
was one of the big festivals where everyone
gets out in the streets and gets drunk and

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:13.479
parties in the major cities of Thailand),
the monks in his temple (so these were the

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.639
privileged students, mostly from the Thai
elite, going to this elite temple), they all

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:24.070
said, "Oh, don't worry about it, we'll do
the same thing we do when we want to go out

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.070
to a nightclub."

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:34.289
And they, uh, they put on baseball hats and,
uh, sort of loose-fitting hip-hop clothing,

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.740
so that nobody would notice that they had
shaved heads, or the shaved heads wouldn't

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.550
look as remarkable, and they went out and
partied.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.289
They joined the crowd.

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:51.970
And, uh, he said that he himself and the other
monks who were there on scholarship from Laos

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:57.660
(there were a couple), they were, y'know,
terrified of this, and they tried to be more

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:04.800
respectful of whatever the tradition was,
raising the question of "How can you respect

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.550
the tradition while defying the reality of
what that tradition is?"

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.550
Because the tradition is that you put on a
baseball hat and you go out and party with

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.590
the other corrupt monks.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.229
So, are you going to fight against that?

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:23.280
Are you maybe going to get kicked out of the
institution you're in because you're not willing

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.870
to play ball with the types of corruption
that are going on there?

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.801
I had contact with two different western monks
who were attached to what many people would

00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:40.030
consider the single most respected temple
in Bangkok, again, with formal connections

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.180
to the monarchy and what-have-you.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:47.080
The, uh, "the marble temple", it's called
in English.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.410
One of them was more brutal than the other
in his assessment --well, I should say, one

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.840
of them was still a monk when I spoke to him
(he was a westerner who was living there as

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.300
a monk) and the other was an ex-monk.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.189
But that ex-monk (I'm not going to give away
too many details), he had risen to the absolute

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:10.060
highest place of prominence possible; he was
working in the offices of monks very directly

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.240
connected to the royal family and the government
--at the absolute highest level.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.400
[He was] the equivalent to being a right-hand
man for the pope in Catholicism.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.919
That guy really moved up the ladder because
he had skills that were useful to the institution.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:30.379
Anyway, he was staying in the marble temple
and, wow, I mean, both the financial corruption

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:35.850
--the fact that everything these monks were
doing was motivated by money, very, very directly

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:42.941
(he was brutally honest in talking about that)--
and the absence of any other motive, of any

00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:47.220
real scholarship going on, any real education,
any real religious practice of any kind (he

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:53.590
was brutally honest about that).

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:57.831
Something else that was outstanding to me...
and that guy spoke to me for many hours, on

00:08:57.831 --> 00:09:02.620
a couple of different meetings... something
else that was outstanding to me in his account

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:09.710
of his experience with the corruption of monastic
Buddhism was that the monks who were not corrupt

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:15.570
were regarded with hatred and contempt by
the organized majority of the monks who were

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.700
there to make money.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:26.210
So, um, that's a dynamic that exists in both
politics and religion, where people will say

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.221
to you, if you're the one person who doesn't
want to be corrupt, "Oh, why do you have to

00:09:30.221 --> 00:09:31.221
cause a problem?"

00:09:31.221 --> 00:09:34.970
"Why do you have to make waves?"

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:40.170
When you're in an institutionally corrupt
context, you're in a situation of conflict

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.050
whether you like it or not.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:48.280
And people are going to be making waves with
you, even if you think you can have an aloof

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:56.850
attitude, a detached attitude, or that you're
not going to, uh... you're not going to be

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.940
a martyr to your ideals.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.710
There are plenty of people surrounding you
who will be all-too-happy to make a martyr

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:08.700
out of you.
