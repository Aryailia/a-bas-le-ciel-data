right<00:00:13.440><c> and</c><00:00:13.599><c> i</c><00:00:13.759><c> don't</c><00:00:14.639><c> what</c><00:00:14.880><c> i</c><00:00:15.040><c> talk</c><00:00:15.200><c> about</c><00:00:15.440><c> is</c>

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 align:start position:0%
right and i don't what i talk about is
 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.349 align:start position:0%
right and i don't what i talk about is
the<00:00:15.599><c> meaning</c><00:00:15.839><c> that</c><00:00:16.000><c> you</c><00:00:16.160><c> can</c><00:00:16.320><c> create</c>

the meaning that you can create
 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:18.790 align:start position:0%
the meaning that you can create

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
so i don't believe there's a meaning
 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.029 align:start position:0%
so i don't believe there's a meaning
that<00:00:18.960><c> someone</c><00:00:19.199><c> else</c><00:00:19.359><c> has</c><00:00:19.520><c> created</c><00:00:20.000><c> for</c><00:00:20.240><c> you</c>

that someone else has created for you
 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.429 align:start position:0%
that someone else has created for you
i<00:00:21.199><c> think</c><00:00:21.359><c> you've</c><00:00:21.600><c> got</c><00:00:21.760><c> to</c><00:00:22.080><c> create</c><00:00:22.400><c> it</c><00:00:22.480><c> yourself</c>

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
i think you've got to create it yourself
 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:24.870 align:start position:0%
i think you've got to create it yourself
so<00:00:23.600><c> that's</c><00:00:23.840><c> very</c><00:00:24.160><c> different</c><00:00:24.480><c> from</c><00:00:24.640><c> saying</c>

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
so that's very different from saying
