00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.710
The scholar-practitioner-divide is a theory
that many people talk about as if it's real,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.190
and as if it always has been real.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.869
To give a rare example of a situation in which
the division, y'know, was kind of open and

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.119
evident to everyone involved, I got a story
from a man who today is a university professor

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.720
of Buddhism about the first time he met the
senior professor (now deceased) A.K.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.720
Warder.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.940
Of course, when I knew A.K.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.100
Warder, I always called him Tony.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.100
A.K.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.170
Warder was at that time a famous and important
scholar of Buddhism, and this much younger

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.880
student walks up behind him to say hello for
the first time, the first time ever meeting

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.880
him.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.641
And the first words out of his mouth, Tony
Warder turns around and says, "Oh, so who

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:58.010
is this then?

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.710
You're not another one of those meditators
are you?"

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.290
And, uh, he said some more words to the effect
that he didn't want to have any students (studying

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.740
Buddhist philosophy) who, uh, engaged in meditation.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.299
He was sick of it already.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:23.390
So, at that moment, for the younger student,
who, indeed, was the kind of guy who was interested

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.890
in meditation, of one kind or another (like
most young people who are getting involved

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.780
in academic Buddhism have some level of sympathy
for the religion as it exists today), you

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.299
have a situation of kind of open hostility,
between someone who presents himself as a

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:46.450
scholar and only a scholar, diametrically
opposed to any kind of tradition or religious

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.450
practice.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.369
And, uh, y'know, I've got to give Tony Warder
some credit: he was not a fraud.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:02:02.509
He was a lot of things, he was despised by
almost everybody... [censored]

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.520
...Canadian newspapers are painfully vague.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.210
Real Talk.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.890
Almost everyone who has told me stories about
the guy (apart from my own interaction with

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.650
him) have always been very negative and very
sad.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.830
But, he knew the texts, he knew the history,
he knew the language, and what he contributed

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.700
to Buddhism is much more valuable than what
he took away from it and, y'know, you've got

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.890
to respect the honesty of that guy standing
up in his pulpit and basically saying, "Look,

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.190
I'm a scholar of Buddhism, but I don't believe
in meditation, and I don't believe in reincarnation,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.290
and I don't believe in magic", that he was
willing to say openly, that what he brought

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.470
to the study of Buddhism was a skeptical,
down-to-earth, outsider's view.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:06.010
That's very rare, to have this kind of open
and clear break between, uh, those who practice

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.450
what they preach, and those and those who
openly preach that they don't practice.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.940
Almost never happens.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.051
The kind of consensus view that there's a
big confrontation between scholars on the

00:03:21.051 --> 00:03:26.530
one hand and practitioners on the other always
seems to quote or derive from the work of

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.820
Charles Prebish, who is now retired but still
alive.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.150
Almost nobody quoting or alluding to the work
of Charles Prebish, almost nobody has actually

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.150
read his work.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.610
They tend to quote a summary of something
that somebody said at a conference that indirectly

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.310
derives from his work, and that's a shame.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.850
Charles Prebish, what he contributed to this,
mostly was just very down-to-earth observations

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.900
about Buddhism as it exists today, in his
experience.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.250
It's not hard to understand, it's not that
much different from a news-reporter just showing

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.030
up at the scene, talking to people, observing
what's going on (and, y'know, I don't mean

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.420
that as an insult, or to diminish what he
did).

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.830
He is, also, one of the most influential people
in the 20th century study of Buddhism, but,

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.320
y'know, his role, like a news reporter, is
very much of an outsider looking in, and,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.850
normally, an outsider arriving with not that
much time to unearth whatever the story was,

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.270
and then move on to the next Buddhist temple,
which he did a lot of.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:38.370
But this influential idea that's somehow wrapped
up in the intellectual legacy of Charles Prebish,

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.300
um, people have definitely come to perceive
it as much more real than it is.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:53.389
I think the conflict that exists really comes
out of the deep uncertainty that most Buddhists

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:59.630
have (and that most Buddhist scholars have)
about what is in "the Bible" of Buddhism --and

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.120
I'm just leaving open [the question of], "What
is 'the Bible'?".

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.960
It's different for different traditions, it's
different for different languages, and so

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.870
on, but every tradition has some set of texts
that are a sort of definitive, canonical Bible

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.770
for the religion, and almost nobody has access
to those texts --neither the monks, nor the

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.672
people who call themselves scholars.

00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:23.660
There are very rare individuals, like Tony
Warder (who gets to be an asshole to everyone

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:31.750
else, because when he shows up at the conference,
he's the only guy who can read the texts)

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.370
and those figures are too few and too far
between, and that's why it's such a loss when

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.740
even one of them turns out to have a bad attitude,
even if that's the only problem.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.510
Obviously, with Tony Warder, that's not the
only problem, and his career was what it was.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.020
And it did have devastating effects on some
people.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:59.220
I've met people who felt that their own lives
were really destroyed by that guy, but that's

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.460
another story.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:09.910
The hostility is not --in my opinion-- it's
not between scholars and practitioners, but

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:17.280
there's a very deep hostility between scholars
who are making their way on the basis of fraud

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.169
and those who are not, and between practitioners
who are getting by with fraud and those who

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.169
are not.

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:28.170
When you do meet a practitioner who's not
a fraud, they live in a state of uncertainty

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.760
about where their next meal is coming from,
and they live in real fear of being kicked

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.690
out of any institution they're in, and so
on, precisely because they refuse to go along

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:46.740
with the scams that very directly bring money
into institutional Buddhism.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:54.310
And, y'know, the situation is fundamentally
the same within academia, it's just much nastier,

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:01.260
it involves a smaller number of people, and
it involves more money, in the hands of fewer

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.200
people.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:10.020
Our tradition in Europe of what academia is,
is [itself] in no way secular.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.949
It's very deeply bound up with church and
religious traditions, that's true even in

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:20.870
the U.S.A., which, obviously, has a relatively
short history of academic institutions.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:26.820
In the 19th century, and into the early 20th
century, in the 19th century in Germany, the

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:34.520
tradition was for a professor to walk down
the aisle, and all the students would stand

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.729
in silence, as the professor walked up the
aisle in the middle, and the professor would

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:46.199
then ascend to a pulpit (not a lectern, a
pulpit) and the professor would tell the students

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:50.750
to be seated, and they would all sit in silence,
and then the professor would lecture.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:56.160
I have read vivid descriptions of this from
American and other scholars who found it shocking

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:06.300
(in the 19th and 20th century) to see this
kind of religious, monastic, oppressive, atmosphere

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:13.290
hanging over what they thought of in more
Socratic terms, as being a theater of ideas,

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.930
open to debate and so on.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:20.603
I remember a friend of mine told me about
his own feeling of shock when he went to France.

00:08:20.603 --> 00:08:24.850
He was involved in departments of Political
Science, where he was expecting some level

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:32.330
of political debate and dissent within the
classroom.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:38.270
What he found the tradition was, this is in
Sciences Po, in France, was of a totally hierarchical,

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:44.380
top-down arrangement of the classroom, where
one professor would sit at a table that was

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.960
on a stage at the front of the room, everyone
would be completely silent, the professor

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.420
would speak without interruption and have
no questions, in a totally authoritarian way,

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.420
[to the] end.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.940
And his own graduate students, right through
to the end of their own PhDs, would never

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:03.630
once be involved in any debate, or any discussion,
or in any way challenge the professor, until

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:09.480
one day, they were the person sitting at that
desk, on the stage, speaking without interruption.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.610
And, uh, [my friend] actually talked about
it with some of the professors and graduate

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.610
students.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:20.810
Y'know, he asked the question, "Is it really
possible for the study of politics to exist

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:30.899
with this kind of hierarchical and heavy institutional
context put around it?"

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:38.830
So, in terms of the supposed division between
scholars and practitioners, y'know, both sides

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:45.500
are generally people who are either sincerely
aspiring to be scholars, or they're at least

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.550
trying to pass themselves off as scholars.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:52.160
Whether they wear a suit and tie, or wear
a Buddhist monk's robes, it's one or the other.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.610
And both sides are involved in practice, of
many kinds; again, Charles Prebish has written

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.950
about that at length.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:06.250
Y'know, frankly, all the academics who present
themselves as secular, if they have made the

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:11.560
decision to devote their lives to the study
of Buddhism, they do have a connection to

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.700
the religion.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:18.130
What that connection is, in each case, is
very different; certainly, it's hard to generalize,

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.730
because the type of people who become professors
of Buddhist studies are, as a rule, eccentric.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:27.300
It's very hard to find two of them who have
anything in common, even when they get married.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:33.890
There are married couples who are in Buddhist
studies, and you can very easily see the difference

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:39.200
between the husband and the wife's views on
Buddhism.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:46.480
When I say fraud, what do I mean by fraud?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:57.740
When I was [censored], I met a [censored]
professor, [censored] today, he's an assistant

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:06.370
professor at [censored], and he gave me a
tour of what was then his employer's institution,

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:12.180
[censored], and when he showed me around,
um, I think he had given this tour several

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.180
times before.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:20.060
He met me, and with great relish and showmanship
and fanfare, he walked through the library

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:26.160
and picked out some books from the shelves,
pointed to the spine of the book, and made

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:32.730
comments on different collections of books
within their library.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:38.550
And every single thing he said to me was factually
wrong.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:48.040
At the time, it's stunning, because, on the
one hand, it's obvious to me, that he's so

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:54.170
used to giving this tour, and that the people
receiving this tour (even if they are PhD

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:59.250
students, or other professors, or even if
they are Buddhist monks) --the people on the

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:06.580
tour have absolutely no ability to be skeptical
of the claims he's making as he walks through

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.580
the library.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.200
Doubtless, 99% of the people uncritically
regard him as a great scholar, because he

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:18.399
can walk through and offer this kind of passing
commentary on different impressive-looking

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:22.430
tomes that are on the shelf of the library.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.170
But, boy, not today.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:30.630
He was giving a tour to somebody who knew
the texts he was alluding to, and who knew

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.400
the languages involved.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:39.940
In some cases these were quite obscure publications,
but, at that time, I knew what was out, I

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.450
knew what existed, and I knew what was on
those shelves.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:50.000
And the types of errors he was making were
so crude, they were so incompetent, that it

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.560
would be like [meeting] someone who is supposed
to be a specialist in ancient Hebrew (in Biblical

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.880
studies) and they're pointing to the phone-book
from Baghdad, and saying, "This is one of

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.911
the most important new publications in Hebrew
studies", [this was] the nature of the language

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.959
errors (and so on) that he was making.

00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:14.589
And, at the time, at first, I was stunned,
because I realized I was talking to someone

00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:18.970
who was a fraud to a much greater extent than
I had guessed from earlier e-mail correspondence

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:24.180
with him (even in e-mail, he was making statements
that showed me he did not know what he was

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.180
talking about).

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.670
But he was very self-confident, and he had
great flair.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.019
And, y'know, I responded...

00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:37.270
I didn't say, "What, are you crazy?", I responded
by trying to get him to slow down, and just

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:41.590
talk to me about the information that was
on the spine of the book.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:47.640
In one case I said to him, "Look, I'm sorry,
but I know the book you're talking about,

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.390
and I have even met with the senior editor
who arranged the publication of this book,

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.769
who oversaw the collection of these texts,
and the editing of it".

00:13:55.769 --> 00:13:59.250
I [had] talked to the editor through a translator,
and so on.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.940
[So] in some cases, I really had direct knowledge
of how these books were put together.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.770
"And what you've said about it is not true
at all.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.420
Can't we talk for a moment...", because also,
I want to share this information with somebody

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.270
who, you hope, is going to be an appreciative
audience or a critical audience, who is going

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.121
to take it on board and make use of it.

00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:26.370
A very small number of people who speak English
will ever take an interest in these books.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.300
And he kept up the act.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:38.140
He refused to slow down, or be skeptical,
or reflect on, the things he was... the line

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:47.440
he was selling me, as we went around, through
that library, and gave me this prepared tour.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.420
That conflict is very real, and very deep.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.160
And the difference between [censored] and
the other professors I've interacted with

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:04.450
is that he is so blithe, and he is on such
an immense ego-trip, that he is what we would

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.110
call "unflappable" in English.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:14.920
He refuses to even slow down enough to feel
ashamed of the nonsense he is selling.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:20.820
And, of course, many of the other professors
I have spoken to are more reflective, are

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.459
more meditative, to be honest.

00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:29.990
And, uh, many times, even when I was still
an undergraduate, and I would just ask simple,

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.079
factual questions, [such as,] "I'm sorry,
don't you mean the 4th century A.D., not the

00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:40.970
4th century B.C.?", sometimes just very simple
questions, with absolutely no ill intentions,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:47.940
and I saw professors have emotional breakdowns,
and, uh... y'know, fly off the handle, get

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:54.990
out of control in various ways, just when
talking about the simplest, factual element,

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.820
of what people in this discipline should know.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.360
That's a real conflict: sincere interest,
vs. fraud.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:08.990
But I've got to tell you, I've spent a lot
of time inside Buddhist institutions, talking

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:15.590
to Buddhist monks; when I talk to Buddhist
monks who are sincere about anything, there's

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.900
no such conflict.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:24.010
Some Buddhist monks are sincere about humanitarian
work, and they'll tell you openly, "I don't

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:30.140
know ancient philosophy, but I know we've
got people in this suburb of Phnom Penh, Cambodia,

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.420
who are dying of A.I.D.S., and they have kids,
and the kids are going to be orphans in 5

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.510
years, and this is what I'm doing about it".

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.860
I've gotten along with those guys fine.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.750
That's a real example, sadly.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:47.510
I've gotten along with monks who are very
sincere about the social and political dimensions,

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:51.540
while being open about their own ignorance
of the ancient texts.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.820
They say, "Well..."...

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:58.620
I remember, I've spoken to several monks who
said openly that what they know about Buddhist

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:05.640
philosophy relied on English, even though
their first language was Chinese, or Cambodian,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.390
or Thai, or what-have-you (or Sinhalese, also
with Sri Lankan monks).

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:15.850
They've said openly that what they know about
ancient Buddhism relies on these Western,

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.630
European interpretations and discussions.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:24.230
And, y'know, many times they were aware that
this had shortcomings, but they were also

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:30.410
aware that other monks who couldn't even read
in English were burdened with a very different

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:38.290
challenge in struggling to make connections
between modern problems and ancient philosophy.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:46.040
So, [now I have] the challenge of trying to
put an upbeat ending on such a depressing

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:53.100
little video lecture.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.880
What is personal integrity?

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:04.890
At a minimum, personal integrity involves
the honesty, the strength and the detachment

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:11.850
to say, "I don't know", when the truth is
that there's a book up on a shelf, and I don't

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.560
really know what's inside the covers.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.900
You may not even know what's really written
on the spine.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:28.370
And there is a conflict, that will perhaps
never end, between people who are involved

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:35.630
in the academic study of Buddhism (or the
openly religious practice of Buddhism), there's

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:43.190
a conflict between people who have integrity,
who will not be bought and sold, and people

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.850
who have no integrity.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:53.720
And, um, y'know, looking back, I know why
everyone hates Tony Warder, I even know why

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:59.160
people hate Richard Gombrich; I really like
Richard Gombrich's character, I really do

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.910
like him; but those guys... [sigh].

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:06.910
Well, I guess it will wait for another video.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:12.250
But, um, we're all left with the question
of how we're going to live with integrity.
