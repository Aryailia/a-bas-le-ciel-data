00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:46.010 align:start position:0%

Yeah<00:06:37.940><c> right</c><00:06:41.630><c> right</c><00:06:43.880><c> so</c><00:06:44.880><c> not</c><00:06:45.030><c> not</c><00:06:45.270><c> in</c><00:06:45.389><c> Taiwan</c><00:06:45.660><c> no</c>

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
Yeah right right so not not in Taiwan no
 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.020 align:start position:0%
Yeah right right so not not in Taiwan no
it's<00:06:46.229><c> it's</c><00:06:46.410><c> it's</c><00:06:46.889><c> an</c><00:06:47.039><c> indoor</c><00:06:47.370><c> closed</c><00:06:47.759><c> track</c>

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's an indoor closed track
 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's an indoor closed track
kind<00:06:48.240><c> of</c><00:06:48.389><c> thing</c><00:06:48.539><c> yes</c><00:06:50.330><c> right</c><00:06:51.330><c> of</c><00:06:51.479><c> course</c><00:06:51.539><c> sure</c>

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 align:start position:0%
kind of thing yes right of course sure
 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.629 align:start position:0%
kind of thing yes right of course sure
sure<00:06:52.350><c> -</c><00:06:52.380><c> so</c><00:06:52.590><c> much</c><00:06:52.740><c> of</c><00:06:52.889><c> course</c><00:06:53.160><c> I'm</c><00:06:53.400><c> not</c><00:06:53.490><c> saying</c>

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
sure - so much of course I'm not saying
 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.129 align:start position:0%
sure - so much of course I'm not saying
there's<00:06:53.850><c> zero</c><00:06:54.150><c> I'm</c><00:06:54.419><c> also</c><00:06:54.600><c> saying</c><00:06:54.960><c> there's</c>

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 align:start position:0%
there's zero I'm also saying there's
 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
there's zero I'm also saying there's
zero<00:06:55.440><c> relationship</c><00:06:56.190><c> but</c><00:06:56.639><c> you</c><00:06:56.699><c> do</c><00:06:57.150><c> the</c><00:06:57.330><c> driving</c>

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 align:start position:0%
zero relationship but you do the driving
 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.510 align:start position:0%
zero relationship but you do the driving
test<00:06:57.870><c> and</c><00:06:58.110><c> how</c><00:06:58.169><c> you</c><00:06:58.229><c> and</c><00:06:58.560><c> how</c><00:06:58.949><c> you</c><00:06:59.039><c> how</c><00:06:59.460><c> you</c>

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
test and how you and how you how you
 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.469 align:start position:0%
test and how you and how you how you
would<00:06:59.759><c> do</c><00:06:59.910><c> in</c><00:07:00.030><c> real-world</c><00:07:00.210><c> conditions</c>

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
would do in real-world conditions
 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:01.939 align:start position:0%
would do in real-world conditions
actually<00:07:00.990><c> this</c><00:07:01.199><c> does</c><00:07:01.410><c> come</c><00:07:01.590><c> back</c><00:07:01.710><c> to</c><00:07:01.740><c> what</c><00:07:01.889><c> I'm</c>

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:01.949 align:start position:0%
actually this does come back to what I'm
 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:03.980 align:start position:0%
actually this does come back to what I'm
saying<00:07:02.130><c> about</c><00:07:02.280><c> about</c><00:07:02.639><c> IQ</c><00:07:03.240><c> versus</c>

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 align:start position:0%
saying about about IQ versus
 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.570 align:start position:0%
saying about about IQ versus
intelligence<00:07:04.830><c> in</c><00:07:04.919><c> a</c><00:07:04.949><c> more</c><00:07:05.039><c> meaningful</c><00:07:05.130><c> sense</c>

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
intelligence in a more meaningful sense
 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.110 align:start position:0%
intelligence in a more meaningful sense
because<00:07:06.389><c> that's</c><00:07:06.750><c> especially</c><00:07:06.990><c> going</c><00:07:07.710><c> to</c>

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
because that's especially going to
 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.890 align:start position:0%
because that's especially going to
correspond<00:07:09.120><c> at</c><00:07:09.210><c> the</c><00:07:09.270><c> low</c><00:07:09.419><c> end</c><00:07:09.449><c> of</c><00:07:09.690><c> the</c><00:07:09.750><c> scale</c>

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
correspond at the low end of the scale
 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.650 align:start position:0%
correspond at the low end of the scale
so<00:07:10.650><c> I</c><00:07:10.680><c> mean</c><00:07:10.919><c> if</c><00:07:11.220><c> you're</c><00:07:11.430><c> actually</c><00:07:11.910><c> blind</c><00:07:12.300><c> if</c>

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
so I mean if you're actually blind if
 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.969 align:start position:0%
so I mean if you're actually blind if
you're<00:07:12.780><c> actually</c><00:07:13.080><c> visually</c><00:07:13.440><c> impaired</c><00:07:13.800><c> if</c>

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
you're actually visually impaired if
 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:16.219 align:start position:0%
you're actually visually impaired if
you're<00:07:14.100><c> actually</c><00:07:14.580><c> have</c><00:07:15.020><c> some</c><00:07:16.020><c> kind</c><00:07:16.139><c> of</c>

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:16.229 align:start position:0%
you're actually have some kind of
 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:17.930 align:start position:0%
you're actually have some kind of
disorder<00:07:16.530><c> that</c><00:07:16.800><c> scatter</c><00:07:17.160><c> is</c><00:07:17.400><c> your</c><00:07:17.550><c> ability</c><00:07:17.669><c> to</c>

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
disorder that scatter is your ability to
 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
disorder that scatter is your ability to

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010 align:start position:0%

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
focus and pay attention and that shows
up<00:07:20.220><c> that</c><00:07:20.250><c> really</c><00:07:20.550><c> impairs</c><00:07:21.060><c> you</c><00:07:21.240><c> doing</c><00:07:21.479><c> the</c>
